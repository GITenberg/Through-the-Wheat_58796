<h1>THROUGH THE WHEAT</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>Dusk, like soft blue smoke, fell with the
dying spring air and settled upon the
northern French village. In the uncertain
light one and two story buildings set along the
crooked street showed crisply, bearing a resemblance
to false teeth in an ash-old face. To
young Hicks, disconsolate as he leaned against
the outer wall of the French canteen, upon
whose smooth white surface his body made an
unseemly blot, life was worth very little.</p>

<p>For nine interminable months William Hicks
had been in France, shunted from one place to
another, acting out the odious office of the military
police, working as a stevedore beside evil-odored
blacks, helping to build cantonments and
reservoirs for new soldiers ever arriving from the
United States.</p>

<p>And he was supposed to be a soldier. He had
enlisted with at least the tacit understanding
that he was some day to fight. At the recruiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
office in Cincinnati the bespangled sergeant
had told him: “Join the marines and see some
real action.” And the heart of William Hicks
had fled to the rich brogue and campaign ribbons
that the sergeant professionally wore.</p>

<p>But was this action? Was this war? Was
this for what William Hicks had come to
France? Well, he told himself, it was not.
Soldiering with a shovel. A hell of a way to
treat a white man. There were plenty of people
to dig holes in the ground, but not many
of them could qualify as sharpshooters. And
Hicks swelled his chest a trifle, noticing the glint
of the metal marksmanship badge on his tunic.</p>

<p>Resting beside him on the ground was a display
of unopened food tins above which rose the
slender necks of bottles. Of the bottles there
were four, prisoning the white wine of the northern
French vineyards. Excessive in number
were the cans, and they looked as if their contents
were edible. But Hicks was not sure.
He had bought them from the wizened little
French clerk who had regarded him with suspicion
through the window of the canteen. For
this suspicion, this slight hostility, Hicks did
not blame the little Frenchman. He had, he
realized, made an ass of himself by pointing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
ambiguously labelled cans piled on the shelves
inside the canteen and saying: “la, combien?”
Now he possessed a choice array of cans of
whose contents he knew nothing. All that he
asked was that he might be able to eat it.</p>

<p>That morning he had marched into the town
with his tired platoon from a small deserted railway
station some miles distant. Once assigned
to the houses in which they were to be billeted,
the men had unstrapped their blankets and
fallen asleep. But not Hicks. He had explored
the village with an eye to disposing of the mass
of soiled and torn franc-notes which he carried
in his pocket. In the French canteen he had
found the place for which he was looking. And
so he had stood before the clerk, demanding to
buy as much of the stock as he could carry.</p>

<p>But the clerk had closed the window, leaving
Hicks with a handful of French money and the
tinned food and four bottles of vin blanc.
Hence his disconsolation. The roll of paper felt
unnatural, superfluous in his pocket. He was
tempted to fling it away. In the morning the
platoon would find the canteen and buy the last
can, the last bottle.</p>

<p>Restive, he ran his lean fingers through his
uncombed hair, wondering vaguely whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
were true that his regiment was soon to depart
for the front.</p>

<p>It must be true, he decided. There had been
an untoward attitude on the part of his officers
since the moment that the departure of the platoon
had been made known. Their destination
had been scrupulously kept from them. In corroboration,
a long-range gun boomed sullenly in
the distance.</p>

<p>The noise produced in him a not unpleasant
shiver of apprehension. He met it, summoning
a quiet smile of scorn. Yes, he would be glad
to go to the front, to that vague place from
which men returned with their mutilated bodies.
Not that he was vengeful. His feeling for the
German army was desultory, a blend of kaleidoscopic
emotions in which hate never entered.
But in conflict, he felt, would arise a reason for
his now unbearable existence.</p>

<p>The grinning weakness which men called authority
had followed him since the day of his
enlistment at the beginning of the war. It had
turned thoughts of valor into horrible nightmares,
the splendor of achievement into debased
bickering. Most of the men, it seemed
to him, had not entered the army to further the
accomplishment of a common motive; they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
enlisted or had been made officers and gentlemen—Congress
had generously made itself the
cultural father of officers—for the purpose of
aiding their personal ambitions.</p>

<p>It had darkened. Hicks gathered up his
sorry feast and sauntered off through the shaking,
mysterious shadows to his pallet of straw.</p>

<p class="tb">Stretched out upon individual beds of straw
which had been strewn over the stone floor, the
members of the platoon were lying before a
huge fireplace that drew badly in the early
spring wind. In all of their nine months in
France this was the first time that they had
thus lain, not knowing what was to come on the
following day, nor caring, being only satisfied
by the warmth which came from the fireplace,
by their sense of feeling intact and comfortable.</p>

<p>In this sense of reconciliation John Pugh, the
Mississippi gambler, forgot his everlasting dice-throwing,
which every pay-day that the platoon
had thus far known had won for him more
money than his company commander received
from the United States Government.</p>

<p>He sighed, elongating his limbs beneath his
blanket. He made an effort to rise, and succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in resting the weight of his torso on his
arm which he had crooked under him. Cautiously
he felt for a cigarette beneath his tunic,
which he was using for a pillow. He got the
cigarette and a match, then held them in his
hand, hesitant.</p>

<p>His eyes, large and dolorous, searched the
dimly lighted room, scanning the recumbent
figures to discover whether they were asleep.
Men were lying, their shoes beside their heads,
their army packs, rifles, leaning against the wall
and the remainder of their equipment scattered
near by. They were silent, motionless.</p>

<p>“I guess I can risk it,” thought Pugh, and
he carefully struck the match and lighted his
cigarette.</p>

<p>As the match was rubbed over the floor
heads appeared; the stillness was broken.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, thought you didn’t have any
more cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“You got fifty francs offa me last month. I
think you ought to give me a smoke!” The
voice was reproachful.</p>

<p>Effectually and instantly Pugh checked the
avalanche of reproach:</p>

<p>“Hey, you fellas, there’s beaucoup mail up
at regimental headquahtas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The clumsy shadows in the darkened room
answered:</p>

<p>“Aw bunk.”</p>

<p>“Cut out that crap.”</p>

<p>“How do you get that way, Jack? You
know there ain’t no mail up at regimental.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Pugh sighed, “if you all don’ wanna
heah f’m your mammy I don’ give a damn....
Oh-o. What you all got, Hicks?”</p>

<p>Hicks had arrived at his billet, his arms filled
with the bottles of wine and the cans of the
questionable contents.</p>

<p>Candles were lighted and set on the helmets
of the men. Bodies rose to a sitting posture,
eyes on Hicks.</p>

<p>“Gimme a drink, Hicksy!”</p>

<p>“Hooray, look what Hicks’s got.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, gimme a drink.”</p>

<p>The voices were clamorous.</p>

<p>“Gimme, gimme? Was your mouth bored
out with a gimlet,” Hicks jeered. “Why didn’t
you buy some?”</p>

<p>They formed a semicircle around the fireplace
in front of which Hicks sat with his plunder.</p>

<p>Over the bottles they grew noisily talkative.</p>

<p>“Say, have you fellows seen any of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
new guys here?” asked Hicks. “I was walkin’
down one of the streets by the Frog canteen
and one of ’em asked me if I was in the balloon
corps. I told him yes, and asked him how he
guessed it, and he said, ‘Oh, I saw that balloon
on your cap.’”</p>

<p>“They sure are a bunch of funny birds. I
ast one of ’em how long he’d been over on this
side and he said: ‘About three weeks—seen
anybody that’s come over lately?’”</p>

<p>A contingent of soldiers which had arrived in
the village that afternoon were, therefore, objects
of scorn and hostility.</p>

<p>“Aw, they’re some of them fellahs that the
wind blew in. Pretty soon they’ll have the
home guards over here.”</p>

<p>“They will like hell! If you could git them
home guards away from home you’d sure have
to hump. They’re home guards—they guard
our women while we’re over here.” The
speaker seemed afraid that his listeners would
not understand that he was stressing the word
<em>home</em>.</p>

<p>“Yeh, they’s one of ’em guardin’ my gal too
close. I got a lettah....”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky to get any kind of a letter.
Here I been for three months and not a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I don’t know whether they all died or what,”
Hicks ended gloomily.</p>

<p>“Aw cheer up, Hicksy, old boy. Maybe your
mail was on that transport that got sunk.”</p>

<p>A head was thrust in the door. It was the
first sergeant.</p>

<p>“Pipe down, you damned recruits. Lights
are supposed to be out at eight o’clock. If you
guys want to git work detail for the rest of your
lives——”</p>

<p>“All right, you dirty German spy. Git the
hell out of here and let us sleep.”</p>

<p>All of the candles had been put out as soon
as the voice of the first sergeant was heard.
The men had flung themselves on their beds.
Now each one pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p>“Who said that?” The first sergeant was
furious. “I’ll work you birds till your shoes
fall off.”</p>

<p>The room answered with loud and affected
snores. The first sergeant, in all of his fierceness,
disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>It was morning.</p>

<p>Sergeant Kerfoot Harriman, bearing with
proud satisfaction the learning and culture he
had acquired in the course of three years at a
small Middle-Western university, walked down
the Rue de Dieu in a manner which carried the
suggestion that he had forgotten the belt of his
breeches.</p>

<p>Approaching a white two-story stone building
which age and an occasional long-distance German
shell had given an air of solemn decrepitude,
Sergeant Harriman unbent enough to
shout stiltedly: “Mailo! Mailo-ho!”</p>

<p>His reiterated announcement was unnecessary.
Already half-dressed soldiers were rushing
through the entrance of the building and
toward the approaching sergeant.</p>

<p>“All right, you men. If you can’t appear in
uniform get off of the company street.” Sergeant
Harriman was commanding.</p>

<p>In their eagerness to hear the list of names
called out the men forgot even to grumble, but
scrambled back through the doorway overflowing
the long hall off of which were six rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
devoid of furniture, which had been converted
into barracks.</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman, feeling the entire amount
of pleasure to be had from the added importance
of distributing the mail—the first the platoon
had received in two months—cleared his throat,
took a steadfast position and gave his attention
to the small bundle of letters which he held in
his hand.</p>

<p>He deftly riffled them twice without speaking.
Then he separated the letters belonging to the
non-commissioned officers, the corporals, and
sergeants from those addressed to the privates.
The non-commissioned officers received their
letters first.</p>

<p>At last:</p>

<p>“Private Hicks,” he read off.</p>

<p>“Here, here I am. Back here.” Private
Hicks was all aflutter. Separated from the letter
by a crowd of men, he stood on tiptoe and
reached his arm far over the shoulder of the
man in front of him.</p>

<p>“Pass it back to him? Pass it back to him?”
voices impatiently asked.</p>

<p>“No!” Sergeant Harriman was a commander,
every inch of him. “Come up and get
it, Hicks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hey, snap out of it, will ya! Call off the
rest of the names.”</p>

<p>A path was made, and Hicks finally received
the letter.</p>

<p>Harriman looked up. “If you men don’t
shut up, you will never get your mail!”</p>

<p>“Private Pugh!”</p>

<p>“Hee-ah. Gimme that lettah. That’s f’m
mah sweet mammah.” Pugh wormed his
small, skinny body through the men, fretfully
calling at those who did not make way quickly
enough. He grasped the letter. Then he
started back, putting the letter in his pocket
unopened.</p>

<p>“Poor old Pugh. Gets a letter and he can’t
read.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t that a waste of stationery?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask the captain to write an’
tell your folks not to send you any more mail?
Look at all the trouble you cause these mail
clerks.”</p>

<p>Several men offered to read the letter to
Pugh, but he did not answer.</p>

<p>An hour later the first sergeant was walking
up and down in front of the billets, blowing his
whistle. Bugle-calls were taboo.</p>

<p>“Shake it up, you men. Don’t you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
you’re supposed to be ready for drill at nine
o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Drill! I thought we come up here to fight,”
voices grumbled, muttering obscene phrases directed
at General Pershing, the company commander,
and the first sergeant.</p>

<p>Men scurried out of their billets, struggling
to get on their packs and to fall in line before
the roll was called.</p>

<p>“Fall in!” the little sergeant shouted, standing
before the platoon. “Right dress!” he
commanded sharply and ran to the right of the
platoon, from where he told one man to draw
in his waist and another to move his feet, and
so on, until he was satisfied that the line was
reasonably straight. “Steady, front!” And in
a very military manner he placed himself in
the proper place before the company and began
to call the roll.</p>

<p>“All present or accounted for, sir,” he reported
to the captain, a note of pride and of a
great deed nobly done ringing in his voice.</p>

<p>The sergeants fell back in rear of the platoons
and the commander ordered “squads right.”
The hobnailed boots of the men on the cobblestones
echoed hollowly down the street.</p>

<p>Stupid-looking old Frenchmen, a few thick-waisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
women, and a scattering of ragged children
dully watched the company march down
the street. For the most part they were living
in the advance area because they had no other
place to go and because they feared to leave
the only homes that they had ever known.</p>

<p>The platoon marched out of the town along
a gravel road and into a green, evenly plotted
field, where they were deployed and where, to
their surprise, a number of sacks, filled with
straw, had been hung from a row of scaffolding.</p>

<p>The platoon faced the sacks, were manœuvred
so that each man would be standing in front of
one of the dummies and were ordered to fix
bayonets. Sergeant Harriman, the nostrils of
his stubby nose flaring wide with zeal, began his
instructions.</p>

<p>“All right, you men. Now you want to forget
that these are sacks of straw. They are
not at all. They are dirty Huns—Huns that
raped the Belgians, Huns that would have come
over to the good old U. S. A. and raped our
women if we hadn’t got into the war. Now,
men, I want to see some action, I want to see
some hate when you stick these dirty Huns. I
want to see how hard you can <em>grunt</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“All ready now. Straight thrust. One, two,
three—now——”</p>

<p>As a body the platoon lunged their bayonets
into the cloth-covered straw.</p>

<p>“Great God! Is that all the pep you’ve got?
Why, you men are stale. What the hell did
you come over here to fight for? Did you ever
hear that you were supposed to be saving the
world for democracy? Now, try it again, and
put some punch in it this time. Let’s hear your
<em>grunt</em>.”</p>

<p>The action was repeated. “Rotten!” yelled
the sergeant. “What the hell are you going to
do when you get up to the front? Do you
think this is an afternoon tea? You act like a
bunch of ribbon-counter clerks, and that’s what
I believe most of you are. Now let’s try the
butt stroke.”</p>

<p>“Butt stroke. One—two—three. Oh, hell.
Where are you aiming, Gillespie? Remember,
you’ve missed him with the bayonet and you’re
trying to soak him in the crotch—in the
<em>crotch</em>, mind you, with the butt of your
rifle.”</p>

<p>Several of the men caught the frenzy of the
sergeant, and at each command they ran, gritting
and grinding their teeth, and grunted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the pieces of straw. From the terrific onslaught
one of the dummies was severed from the scaffold,
and the sergeant cried out:</p>

<p>“That’s the first real spirit I’ve seen to-day.
That’s the way to kill them!” he called to the
man who had wrested the dummy from its place.
“Come up here and show these dopes how to
kill.”</p>

<p>Exultant, the man left his place and strutted
over to the sergeant. Taking a position before
one of the dummies, he proceeded to show
the rest of the platoon how really and frightfully
to stab the dummies until their stuffing broke
through the sacks.</p>

<p>“He’s working to be a corporal, the dirty
scut. And oh, if he does get to be a two-striper
won’t he make us step around. Boy!” Hicks
muttered to Pugh, who was standing next to
him and whose bayonet had failed even to pierce
the covering of the sack.</p>

<p>“He won’t pull none of that old stuff on me.
Ah’ll tell Lieutenant Bedford and he’ll make
him be good or I won’t give him any more
money to gamble with,” Pugh drawled.</p>

<p>“You sure have got a stand-in with Bedford,
Pugh. I often wondered how you did it.”</p>

<p>“Hell, that’s easy. When he was down at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
St. Nazaire I lent him ’bout a thousand francs
to gamble with, and he ain’t never paid me.”</p>

<p>The platoon assembled and marched back to
their billets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Three days were spent by the platoon at
the little village. On the evening of the
third day, just as the men had formed in a long,
impatient line before the field kitchen, with
their aluminum food receptacles held out to
catch the thin, reddish stew surlily thrown at
them, the company commander walked among
them bearing words of dour import. Captain
Powers talked softly and gently, wringing the
words from his heart, burnishing them with a
note of sadness:</p>

<p>“Stay close to your billets to-night after
chow, men. We’re moving up to the front
some time to-night.”</p>

<p>He passed by them, and those whom he
passed shuffled their feet, looking furtively at
the ground. There was very little comment.
The shuffling line was funereal. Men smiled at
Captain Powers, but their smiles lacked certitude.</p>

<p>When they had packed their belongings in
the stipulated military manner the pall remained,
vaguely hanging over them, drawing
them together in their common aversion from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the future. In the rooms they sat on their
packs, nervously waiting to move.</p>

<p>The moonlight streamed in through the window
and showed the gray whitewashed walls of
the deserted room. The fireplace was a black
maw.</p>

<p>Night fell in mysterious folds, giving the appearance
of unfamiliarity to the squat French
houses, the spired Gothic church, the trees
which drooped their boughs in a stately canopy
over the smooth gray road. The men, their
feet striking against the cobblestones, clumped
through the village streets and along the road.</p>

<p>The sector toward which the platoon was
moving had once been the scene of violent conflict,
but of late, with the more important military
manœuvres taking place farther west, it
had dropped into a peaceful desuetude. It lay
a few miles from Verdun, among the green-covered
concealed fortresses, from which the
noses of mammoth artillery unexpectedly rose.
Tops of thickly wooded hills reared evenly in an
unbroken line. Between the crests the shadow-hidden
valleys rested serene, content with their
secrets of the dead. Along the base of the
mauve chain of hills wound a trench from
which French soldiers, most of whom were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the farther side of fifty, sat around in dugouts
and drank their ration of Pinard or squatted,
their shirts off, hunting lice in the seams.</p>

<p>The platoon marched up in the pitch-black
night, slipping, from time to time, off the slimy
duck boards which had been placed in the bottom
of the trench to prevent traffic from being
buried in the mud. Their packs, with hip rubber
boots, bandoliers of ammunition, bombs,
and shovels, bowed them over as they cautiously
and cursingly made their way through the communication
trench.</p>

<p>Somewhere ahead a white light flared with a
sputtering noise.</p>

<p>“Stand fast!” Lieutenant Bedford called out
peremptorily.</p>

<p>The men stood as rocks, their arms crooked,
covering their faces. The light dropped slowly
and unemotionally to the ground, dying out.
Again all was blackness.</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman, who had gone ahead as
billeting officer, now joined the platoon and
piloted the men into the trench. The main
trench was much wider than the communication
trench, but passage along it was difficult
because of the half-checkered manner in which
it had been laid out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Not waiting to be relieved, the French soldiers
one by one had disappeared into the night.
Now the platoon stood silent and ill at ease.
No one knew where to go, and so the entire
body was ordered to remain standing in the firing
bays until morning.</p>

<p class="tb">Dawn broke upon a desolate field where rusty
barbed wire clung awkwardly to the posts on
which it had been strung. There were a few
gnarled and stunted trees, the wreck of what
once had been a French farmhouse, and that
was all. Hicks peered over the parapet, wondering
how near he was to the enemy. He
stepped upon the firing step of firm clay. A
few yards away were the torn and rusted tracks
of the Paris-Metz railway. Beyond that was
just an uncared-for field, which, in the distance,
lost itself in the gray of the horizon.</p>

<p>He experienced a strange feeling of awe, as if
he were looking upon another world. The early
sun threw the trees and barbed wire into a queer
perspective and gave them a harsh, unreal
aspect.</p>

<p>In the early springtime this particular sector
looked very much like one of the calm farms
which Hicks was accustomed to see in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
parts of Ohio. The birds sang as lightheartedly,
the sun was as bright, the grass was as
green and fragrant over the slightly rolling field.
All was quite as it should be. Only Hicks was
out of the picture. Ordinarily he would have
been contemplating such a pastoral scene from
the window of a railway train or from a northern
Michigan farmhouse, where he would have been
spending his summer vacation. He would have
been dressed in a blue flannel suit, with a sailor
hat, a white shirt of some soft summery material
and a rather striking tie. His hose would
have been of silk and his cool white underclothes
would have been of the “athletic” type, Hicks
mused.</p>

<p>Then he became aware of himself. In place
of the straw sailor there lay very heavily on his
head a steel helmet that, though he had thought
it chic for a while, was now no more distinguished-looking
than the aluminum dish in
which his food was rationed to him. He had
worn his drab shirt for two weeks, and there
were black rings around the collar and wrists.
His gas-mask, girded over his chest, looked foul
and unclean; he had used it for a pillow, for a
dining-table, and often, he realized, it had been
thrown in some muddy place when he had sickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of having it about him like an ever-present
albatross. The knees of his breeches were as
soiled and as uncomfortable as his shirt, and his
puttees and shoes were crusted thickly with
dried mud.</p>

<p>His stock-taking of his dress was interrupted
by the knowledge that a persistent vermin was
exploring the vicinity of his breast. He could
not apprehend it because of his gas-mask,
which, suspended from his neck, was strapped
to his chest.</p>

<p class="tb">After the first few days life in the trenches
became inordinately dull, so dull that an occasional
shell fired from the artillery of either side
was a signal for the members of the platoon to
step into the trench and speculate where it
struck.</p>

<p>Every night two squads of the platoon stood
watch while the others slept. Hicks, with Bullis,
was stationed in a shell hole a few yards
ahead of the front line. The shell hole was half
filled with water and it was cold. After three
or four hours the hip rubber boots made Hicks
think that his feet were a pair of dead fish in a
refrigerator.</p>

<p>It was customary for the corporal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
guard and the lieutenant each night to inspect
the outposts, but because the ground was wet
and because of the strands of unmanageable
barbed wire the lieutenant had stayed in his
dugout, permitting the corporal of the guard to
have the honor of inspecting.</p>

<p>One night, when the dampness seemed like a
heavily draped ghost that wanted to kiss Hicks’s
entire body, and when his eyes had completely
tired from the strain of imagining that the
stumps and posts in the field were moving,
Hicks fell asleep. In his cramped position, sitting
on a board over a shell hole, with his feet
in the icy water, Hicks’s sleep was full of fantastic
dreams. He might have slept until the
noonday sun awakened him, had he not slipped
from his seat and sprawled into the water.
This awakened Bullis, who invariably went to
sleep, remaining so until the watch was over.</p>

<p>“What the hell’s coming off?” Hicks awakened
with a jerk. “Christ, it’s time to go
in.”</p>

<p>They observed the sun, which was slowly
climbing over the horizon and shedding the
earth with a silvery light. The sky was almost
smoked-pearl colored, and before it the trees and
barbed wire made sharp sentinels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Silently they picked up their rifles and slunk
into the trench. Answering the guard’s challenging
“Halt, who’s there?” with an “Oh,
shut up,” they stepped on the slippery duck
board.</p>

<p>“Say, Hicksy, you’d better look out. What
the hell were you guys up to last night?” the
guard asked.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? We weren’t up to
anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, old Hepburn came back here after being
out to your hole, a-cussin’ like hell. He
said you guys couldn’t take advantage of your
friendship with him like that and get away
with it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he meant. Let’s beat
it, Bullis.”</p>

<p>They went to their dugout, where they slept
with their shoes beneath their heads, to keep,
as Hicks almost truthfully remarked, the rats
from carrying them away.</p>

<p>The major’s orderly, his dignity wrestling
with the slippery footing of the duck boards,
marched down the trench from battalion headquarters.
Stopping in front of the dugout
which Hicks and Bullis had entered, he removed
his helmet, patted his hair, and called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is Private Hicks in there? Tell Private
Hicks Major Adams wants to see him.”</p>

<p>His hair a rat’s nest, and a heavy beard on
his muddy-looking face, Hicks looked out of
the entrance of the dugout.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>The orderly turned about and marched back
toward battalion headquarters with Hicks following
him.</p>

<p class="tb">Major Adams belonged to that type of officer
each of which you meet with the feeling that
he is the sole survivor of the school of regular
soldiers. He was a tall, slim, very erect person.
His face was ascetic, though gossip about
his personal affairs proclaimed him to be fiercely
lustful. He wore his campaign hat adeptly. He
limped as he walked, from an unhealed gunshot
wound received in the Philippines. Campaign
ribbons were strung across his breast. With
him authority was as impersonal as the fourth
dimension. He was adored and held in awe by
half of the battalion.</p>

<p>Private Hicks stepped inside the major’s
dugout and saluted.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me, sir?”</p>

<p>“Hicks, you were reported this morning to
have gone to sleep while on outpost duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Hicks started visibly. “That’s true, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, what the hell kind of a soldier are you,
anyway?” Major Adams fairly bit his words
loose.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I mean, I guess I’ve
been a pretty good soldier.”</p>

<p>“You have like hell, Hicks, and you know it.
Now, why did you go to sleep on watch?”</p>

<p>Hicks knew that if he were court-martialled
his sentence might be life imprisonment. It
might be anything, he reflected, that the group
of morons sitting in solemn judgment might
decide to give him.</p>

<p>Major Adams also knew it.</p>

<p>“Sir, the hours are too long. Nobody can
stay awake when he goes on watch eight hours
every night.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Major Adams raised an eyebrow
forbiddingly.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, there’s two feet of water in the
shell hole where my post is, and I guess I got
so numb with cold that I went to sleep.”</p>

<p>“And you never thought to bail it out? I
knew that officers were so damned dumb that
they needed dog-robbers, but I didn’t know
that enlisted men were. Now, Hicks, you
haven’t a case at all. But”—he was silent a
moment—“some day you might make a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
soldier. You wouldn’t have a chance if you
were to get a general court martial, because the
judges would have you hung as an example.
Hicks,” he said, “I’m going to let this drop.
You may go.”</p>

<p>Mumbling a “thank you, sir,” Hicks very
properly about-faced and left the dugout.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>The platoon had been in the trenches for
about six weeks. Everything had been
quiet, well-ordered. Occasionally a shell from
the German batteries would start lazily off and
end up with terrific speed in the platoon’s
trench. Once or twice men were killed when
the shells struck, and their bodies were hurried
away to the dressing station; one morning the
body of a red-haired German, an immense fellow
with a broad forehead, large wide eyes, and
a huge mouth, was found fastened to the strands
of barbed wire in front of Hicks’s post. There
was a hole in his side made by the explosion of
a small hand-bomb. Besides that, there was
nothing of interest.</p>

<p>In fact, there was too little of interest. Not
even a prisoner had been taken, although the
colonel of the regiment had let it be known that
the first man to capture a prisoner would be
given a fifteen-days leave to Aix-le-Bains. So it
was decided that a raiding party was what was
needed to resuscitate the platoon from its lethargy.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that when Hicks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Bullis set out through the trench toward their
shell hole one night they were stopped by the
lieutenant and told that they had been relieved
for the night and were to return to their dugout
and await his orders.</p>

<p>Hicks was disturbed. He felt as if the lieutenant’s
orders had in some way to do with his
sleeping on watch. He had not minded the
consequences so much when he was walking
toward battalion headquarters, but now that
everything with regard to the affair seemed to
have been smouldering, he was fearful. Being
rather reckless, probably the first time that
Major Adams’s remark that he might get a general
court martial was fully realized by him
was at the moment when he and Bullis had been
sent back to their dugout.</p>

<p>Now he sat, his head bowed and his hands
clasped before him. What the hell was he to
do? It was the first time he had thought of his
family. What would Maisie say when she
discovered that he, William Hicks, was in Fort
Leavenworth? What would the gang at the
office say? And his mother? Maybe they
might order him to be shot! This was a mess.
But no, wasn’t there a general order recently
made to the effect that no one in the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Expeditionary Forces could be executed without
permission of President Wilson? Sure there
was. Good of the old horse-face to think of
that. But maybe there was a way to get out
of it yet. He considered for a moment the advisability
of clambering over the trench and
setting forth into that unexplored field, never
to return unless he brought a German prisoner
with him. Let’s see, how had they done it, he
mused. There were plenty of heroes who could.
They’d just fill their pockets with hand-grenades
and blow up a machine-gun nest. “Major
Adams, I fulfilled your prediction! Here!”—indicating
three fierce-looking Germans with
the stump of his left arm, which had been shot
off during his single-handed assault. “And
there were five more, but I would have had to
carry them.” Bunk.</p>

<p>“All right, Hicks and Bullis. Are you all
set?” Lieutenant Bedford, with his aggressive
little mustache, was peering into the dugout
from the trench. “Here’s some blacking for
your bayonets. We’re going on a raiding party
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Hooray. That’s the stuff.” But the voice
of Bullis was weak and shaky. “When do we
go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Hicks was nonplussed. He hastily wondered
whether he had said a prayer that had been answered.
He wanted some source to lay this
bit of good fortune to. And at the same time
he doubted whether it was unalloyed fortune,
whether there were not some disagreeable part
to be performed. So he said nothing, but began
in a businesslike manner to dim the lustre of
his bayonet with the blacking Bedford had
given to him.</p>

<p>“We’ll be ready to start in a half-hour.
We’ve got to wait for guides from the Intelligence
section.” Lieutenant Bedford walked
away.</p>

<p>When the guides arrived and the representatives
from each platoon were assembled it was
night, and so dark that one could not see another
in front of him. A lieutenant and a sergeant
from the Intelligence section led the way,
with Hicks and Bullis sandwiched in the middle
of the long line that kept from separating
by the man in rear holding to the shoulder of
the man in front of him.</p>

<p>Instead of leaving the trench by Hicks’s shell
hole, the party turned in the opposite direction,
and, after walking along the slippery duck
boards for ten or more minutes, climbed over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
firing bay and worked their way through a path
that a succession of well-placed shells had blown
in the barbed wire.</p>

<p>Their feet, scuffing through the tall grass,
hissed like a scythe cutting heavy weeds. That,
and an occasional cough, were the only noises
of the night. Suddenly Hicks’s foot struck a
large, yielding substance. He felt with his feet,
prodding into the thing, which caused a fearful
stench to rise.</p>

<p>“Hey, what’s this?” he softly called, and the
Intelligence-section sergeant came running back
only to exclaim in a voice that had been hardened
by one other raiding party: “That? Why,
that’s only a dead Boche.”</p>

<p>A moment afterward an automatic rifle broke
nervously into a series of put-put-puts.</p>

<p>As one man, the party fell flat on their stomachs.</p>

<p>“Put-put-put. Put-put-put,” said the automatic
rifle.</p>

<p>“Damnation,” Bedford cursed. “It’s somebody
from our lines firing at us.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t talk so loud,” one of the men
said angrily, “or you’ll have both sides on us.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant from the Intelligence section
gave orders for the men to lie prone and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
crawl after him. After a while he rose, motioning
for the others to get up.</p>

<p>“I think,” he said, talking to Bedford in an
undertone, “that this is the place where we get
back in the trench. Let’s count up our men
and see if they are all here.”</p>

<p>They counted as many times as a surgeon
counts the sponges he uses in an operation, but
each count only made more certain that there
was one man missing. Investigation showed
them that the lost man was Corporal Olin, from
the adjoining company.</p>

<p>While they were debating upon what course
to take, they noticed from their lines a green
rocket fired into the air.</p>

<p>“Gas,” hoarsely cried the lieutenant of the
Intelligence section, struggling to get on his
respirator.</p>

<p class="tb">Poor Hicks knew not what to do. Before the
rocket had been fired he had about decided to
return to look for the missing corporal. But
with a respirator on he could hardly breathe,
not to consider finding his way in the dark.
But of a sudden he whipped off his mask and
started off in the direction from which they
had crawled. No one noticed his leaving, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
each man was too much taken up with his own
affairs.</p>

<p>Hicks walked for a while, until he felt that
he had neared the place where the automatic
rifle had begun firing at them. Then he
dropped upon his knees, and with his hands
spread out as far along the ground as he could
spread them, felt for the lost body. Perspiration
was drenching him. It ran down his face
and dropped off his chin, to splash unconcernedly
on the canvas covering of his mask. He
felt as if all the blood of his body was in the
veins of his face. There! Certainly it was a
body.</p>

<p>“Olin,” he whispered. “Olin.” But there
was no answer. He felt along the body until
his hand touched the face. It was warm, and
then he knew that he had found Olin. But not
Olin! Just a body that had once been Olin.
For Olin was dead. Along the tunic and under
the respirator box was a warm, sticky substance.
Hicks placed his hand over the breast above the
heart. It failed to beat.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” he muttered, and started to
crawl back, hardly caring whether he reached
the raiding party or not.</p>

<p>To have saved Corporal Olin, to have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
him into the trench, staggering under the weight
over his shoulder, would, he realized, have exonerated
him completely in the eyes of Major
Adams. Further, he would have received either
a Distinguished Service Cross or a Croix de
Guerre. But how could he, what sort of a fool
would he have looked like, carrying a dead man
over his shoulder all the way into the trench!
Well, it was simply a case of misplaced heroism.
He shrugged his shoulder and went on.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the place where he had
left the party, just enough light had broken to
enable him to see them sprawled on the ground.
With their respirators still on they seemed, in
the dim light, like pompous owls.</p>

<p>Hicks approached, casually inquiring why
they had not taken off their masks. The lieutenant
of the Intelligence section, after wildly
motioning with his hands, took off his mask,
sniffed, and proceeded to curse Hicks for not
informing him that the gas had blown away.</p>

<p>“We might have been killed out here any
minute, you damned bonehead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we probably will be killed now if
we don’t get out of this pretty soon. In five
minutes it will be broad daylight. Besides, the
gas alarm was all a fake,” Hicks answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Now all the men had returned their respirators
to the boxes which were fastened by a cord
around their necks to their breasts. The sergeant
of the Intelligence section set out to find
the path in the barbed wire, but there was none
where he looked. He turned back, the men
following after him like lost sheep, and after
sneaking along the wire for some minutes,
stopped.</p>

<p>“Hey, you over there in the trench. Pass
the word along that the raiding party’s coming
in,” the sergeant of the Intelligence section
called toward the trench.</p>

<p>One of the sentries in the firing bay heard
him, obeyed, and the raiding party dashed
through the wire and spilled into the trench.
The company commander, a former professor
of English at a Texas college, emerged from a
near-by dugout and warmly wrung the hand
of the lieutenant from the Intelligence section.</p>

<p>“My God, I thought you boys were surely
to be killed! You see, I—I must have forgotten
that the raiding party was still out, and
when I heard that machine-gun firing I thought
the Germans were making an attack, so I signalled
for a barrage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you sent up the gas signal instead of
the barrage signal,” Bedford interposed.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was just it. I thought that I was
firing a red rocket and instead I was firing a
green one.” He broke off quickly. “But you
got in all right?”</p>

<p>“All right but for one man,” said Bedford.</p>

<p>“And where is he?” the captain asked.</p>

<p>“He—he’s dead,” Hicks told the assembly.</p>

<p>Bedford turned quickly. “Hicks, how do
you know he’s dead?”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw him. You can see for yourself.
He’s out there dead.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>The platoon had been promised a relief for
three weeks. Each day some orderly or
other would come past, announcing that on the
following night there was certain to be a relief.
Sometimes it was the French who once more
were to take over the sector. Again it was the
British. British soldiers were reported to have
been seen in a near-by town. And the platoon?
First it was going to Zeebrugge to
storm the Mole. Another time the platoon
was to be disorganized and returned to the
United States to be used as recruiting and training
officers. Sometimes they were all to go on
board ship as a mark of appreciation of their
valor. This last always was circulated about
by one of the older men who had seen service
on the battleships.</p>

<p>But one night, before dark, Lieutenant Bedford
passed the word along that the men were
to stand by, ready to be relieved. And in an
hour’s time their entire equipment had been
assembled, and they stood ready to depart.</p>

<p>Slowly the hours passed, but about midnight
the beat of the feet of heavily laden men, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
curses and their comment to one another could
be heard along the communication trench.
Bedford, much excited, cautioned each man on
sentry duty to look sharply, for it was during
the time of relief that the enemy often chose to
attack. Finally each of the old sentries had
given his special orders to the new sentry, and
had slung on his pack and assembled where the
platoon stood waiting. They plodded off, sloshing
through the mud, with now and again a
man slipping off the duck boards and floundering
hip-deep in the mud. The communication
trench was tortuous and long. It was morning
before the last man had got out of it and
upon the road that took them on their way.</p>

<p>The moon was full and round. Through the
shapely leaves of the trees, set at regular intervals
along the winding gravel road, it shone,
divinely lighting up the way for the tired, mud-caked
platoon that straggled along out and
away from the front. For the first three miles
the platoon had kept intact, but now, one by
one, the weaker were dropping out to rest by
the side of the road. Lieutenant Bedford and
Sergeant Harriman, whose heavy marching
equipment had been thrown on the company
supply cart, marched gaily in front. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
were no packs on their backs to bring their
shoulder-blades together until they nearly
touched; nor were there any straps to cut into
the muscles of their shoulders until their arms
were numb.</p>

<p>Finally Hicks, with a nervous, infuriated, impotent
“Oh, the hell with it,” dropped out and
threw his equipment into the ditch. “Let the
dirty dogs walk their heads off.” Two others
dropped out with him and, contrary to orders,
all three lighted cigarettes.</p>

<p>Puffing away at his cigarette, one of the men
began: “If I ever get out of this man’s war
they’ll have to hunt me with cannons to get me
in another.”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em. They sure will. When I git
out of this outfit I’m goin’ up into Montana and
buy a ranch, and I’m goin’ to dig trenches and
put up barbed wire and git me some guns and
spit at the whole bunch of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Why the hell do that? You can do all of
that stuff here.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, but I wouldn’t have no God-damned
mail-order shavetails tellin’ me what to do and
what not to do. That’s what I hate.”</p>

<p>“Well, there won’t be any more wars after
this one, anyway. This is the war to end war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
After we lick these Boches everything will be
all right.”</p>

<p>Hicks rose, faintly nauseated. He flung his
cigarette away, threw his equipment over his
shoulders, and walked on.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the place where the platoon
was to rest he felt quite giddy. He slipped
his pack from his shoulders and leaned it against
the side of the long, low, slatted bunk house.
Of course there was a place there for him to
sleep. But, somehow, he did not want to sleep.
His stomach seemed about to tie itself into a
knot, and he felt that this could be prevented
by something hot to drink. He wondered
where the galley was; the cooks were sure to
have some hot coffee. A man passed, and
Hicks asked him whether the cook wagons had
yet arrived.</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t. They never get here,
you know. But there’s an old goof in that
building over there that’s got some chocolate.
Why don’t you get some?”</p>

<p>Hicks started away in the direction the man
had pointed. Sure enough, the place was
crowded with soldiers, and many of them
were drinking from thick mugs. Hicks edged
toward the counter and asked for a drink. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Y. M. C. A. man filled a mug with hot, thin
chocolate. It was the most pleasant sight
Hicks had seen in months. He reached for it
and was about to drink when something in the
man’s eyes made him hesitate.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t give this chocolate away!”
said the man, turning up a corner of his long,
sallow face.</p>

<p>“How much is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s half a franc, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>Hicks was about to put down the mug of
chocolate, when a soldier from the First Regular
division stepped forward and offered him
the money, and then faced the man behind the
counter.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine dirty slacker, you are. These
men have been out in the trenches for heaven
knows how long, and they come back dog-tired
and hungry, and you refuse to give them a
glass of your skimmed chocolate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” said Hicks. “You know
the kind he is. Why talk to him?”</p>

<p>He went back to the bunk house, found his
bed, and crawled into it, not stopping to undress.</p>

<p class="tb">For five hours the platoon had slept. When
dawn, like a fifty-year-old virgin, was showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
its hard, cold face, the men had stumbled down
into the valley of Bois La Vec. After waiting
outside for half an hour they were permitted to
enter one of the long, low, vermin-infested
bunk houses which lay in the valley. From
their sleepless nights on sentry duty, their lack
of food, and the long, punishing march from
the trenches, they were thoroughly exhausted.
Many of the men were in such a state of fatigue
that they dropped on the straw beds which had
been provided for the French army in 1914,
without stopping to take off their muddy shoes.
And they slept dreamlessly, sodden beings with
senses so dulled they could not think of food.
The mess sergeant had passed through the
bunk house, loudly and virtuously asserting
that the daily fare was to be had. Not one of
the men had stirred.</p>

<p>A large touring-car, its wind-shield placarded
with two white stars cut in a field of red,
drove down the valley along the gravel road,
and turned toward the bunk houses where the
soldiers who preferred sleep to food—and they
had not tasted of food for twenty-four hours—were
lying.</p>

<p>The motor stopped, and a lieutenant, with
a curled mustache, leaned a trifle forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from his seat beside the chauffeur and called:</p>

<p>“Where is the sentry of this camp?”</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stepped out of the car and
strode precisely and firmly toward the bunk
house.</p>

<p>He spoke loudly. “Where is the sentry of
this camp?”</p>

<p>Most of the men were too sleepy even to curse
at the intruder. One or two voices impolitely
commanded him to “shut up,” and one voice
mumbled: “Where do you think you are at,
anyway?”</p>

<p>Enraged at this disrespect, the lieutenant
decided not to leave until he had aroused some
one.</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman, who for once had been
forced to sleep with the common soldiers, awakened,
and, seeing the lieutenant with the insignia
upon his collar worn by officers attached
to the General Staff, dived from his bunk like
a jack-rabbit, saluting before his feet touched
the ground.</p>

<p>The lieutenant roared: “Where is your company
commander?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get him, sir!” And Sergeant Harriman
scurried off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned three feet in rear and three inches
to the left of Captain Powers.</p>

<p>“How do you do, lieutenant?” Captain
Powers rubbed his sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>“Captain,” the lieutenant’s voice rang out,
“Major-General Bumble will be ready to inspect
your organization in”—he looked at his
wrist-watch—“two hours.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.” Captain Powers returned
the lieutenant’s salute. He again rubbed his
eyes and turned to Sergeant Harriman.</p>

<p>“Harriman, have the men got up immediately,
police up, and be ready to stand inspection
in one hour and a half.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.” Sergeant Harriman saluted
sharply.</p>

<p>“And Harriman.”</p>

<p>“Sir!”</p>

<p>“Pass the word on to the sergeants of the
other platoons. We officers have had a pretty
hard night of it, and I am going to try and get
some sleep before the general returns.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman ran through the bunk
houses, informing the other platoon sergeants
of their fortune.</p>

<p>That finished, he returned to his own bunk
house, and, starting along the row of sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
men, unerringly picked the corporals of the
squads and instructed them to awaken their
squads.</p>

<p>Soon the bunk house was filled with cries of:
“Up you come, you dopes. Rise and shine.”</p>

<p>“Is everybody up?”</p>

<p>“Then fall in beside your bunks and answer
to roll-call.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Sergeant Harriman, as he finished
calling the platoon call, “you’ve got jist
one hour to police up and be ready to stand
general inspection. Snap into it.”</p>

<p>Meeting between the platoon and general
officers had been very limited; each man was
overwhelmed with awe at the thought of
a major-general inspecting him. The scene
changed to one of frenzied activity.</p>

<p>Dampened rags were rubbed over the stocks
of the rifles; the rifle bores were cleaned, their
chambers, trigger-guard, and other metal pieces
were meticulously brushed; knives were put into
use to scrape off the mud from the shoes and
clothing; the blankets were stripped from the
bunks and rolled into neat packs; water was
found and stubbles of beard disappeared magically
under the sharp edges of razors, or else
were hidden by heavy coatings of talcum powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour afterward the platoon was in line
in front of the bunk house. Clicking his heels
sharply, for he wore barracks shoes because his
tender feet were unable to stand the heavy hobnails
issued to the soldier, Sergeant Harriman
halted before his command.</p>

<p>“Ha-right, dress.” His diaphragm, which
had been expanded, noticeably contracted as
he uttered the command of execution. “Back
just a trifle, Hayes. Move your feet....
Come out, you man in the third squad of the
front rank. Nobody’s going to hurt you. Step
out a bit. Dammit, move your feet. All right,
Corporal Kahl, suck in your gut and throw out
your chest. There....” The moment was
tense. “Stea-a-dy. Front.” The left arms
of the men were dropped smartly at their
sides.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford, traces of sleepiness still
in his eyes, came forward and took charge of
the platoon. He thrust out his arm, exposing
a small gold wrist-watch beneath his cuff. Giving
the watch an off-hand glance, he raised his
voice: “All right, men, if you’ll keep one foot
in place I’ll give you at ease. No talking.”
He walked to the rear of the platoon and began
to converse with Sergeant Harriman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pipe down, you men, or you’ll stand at
attention!” Sergeant Harriman commanded.</p>

<p>The company commander came. He stood
before the company and received the lieutenant’s
report. The company, which had been
called to attention during the formality, was
given at ease again. They stood shuffling their
feet. One man surreptitiously drew from his
pocket a piece of tobacco, bit loose a small portion
of it and returned it, unnoticed.</p>

<p>An hour passed.</p>

<p>Along the line voices were heard to remark:
“Are we gonna stay here all day? They might
at least feed us before they break us out like
this. A hell of a note.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman rose grandly to the occasion.
“Shut up, you bunch of agitators. I’ll
drill you till your shoes fall off.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have to drill me much. Mine
already have holes in them,” some one remarked.</p>

<p>“Who said that?” Sergeant Harriman was
furious.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford stepped in front of the
platoon and called the men to attention.</p>

<p>The second hour had passed.</p>

<p>A huge touring-car rounded the road and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
stopped. The company commander, in magnificent
tones, commanded them: “Company
at-ten-shun. Open ranks. March.... Steady....
Front.”</p>

<p>He saluted Major-General Bumble, who had
stepped out of the touring-car.</p>

<p>“How do you do, captain.”</p>

<p>The major-general, followed by his lieutenant,
followed by another, followed by the company
commander, followed by the first sergeant,
walked pompously along the line of the front
rank. The driver of the touring-car sent his
car smoothly between the ranks. At the other
end of the company the car stopped. The
major-general, the lieutenant with the curled
mustache, and another officer, climbed in and
the car spurted away.</p>

<p>The ranks were closed, the company was reprimanded
for its slovenly appearance and dismissed.</p>

<p class="tb">Instead of measuring up to the platoon’s conception
of a rest camp, the routine was more
like that of an intensive training camp. Each
morning there were close-order drills, at which
Sergeant Harriman would distinguish himself
by giving the platoon a difficult command: “To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the rear, squads right about, right by squads,
on right into line,” he would proudly call off,
ending with a very sharp “March!” For a
while the platoon obeyed, and in an orderly
manner carried out the command. One day,
after Sergeant Harriman had given the command
of execution, the right guide of the platoon
continued to march forward.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter there, right guide?
Can’t you hear? Platoon, halt!”</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman hurried forward and stood
before the guide. “What the devil is the matter?
You ought to know that command by
this time.”</p>

<p>The right guide spoke: “There is no such
command any more.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? How dare you!”
Sergeant Harriman was exasperated. The guide
was calm.</p>

<p>“We’re under army regulations and you can’t
give more than one command at a time.”</p>

<p>“When I get you up before the company
commander for insubordination you’ll think
otherwise. Wipe that smile off your face, you
men back there.”</p>

<p>He manœuvred them about until he had exhausted
all of the commands that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
think of. Then he ordered double-time, and
they ran around the field, in the burning hot
sun, for fifteen minutes. It would have been
longer, but the company commander, passing
by, ordered the platoon to be halted, and, calling
the sergeant aside, told him to stop.</p>

<p>Such occurrences served the platoon well, for
the men were angered and taken away from
their more intimate troubles. In the evening
the rifts of the day would be forgotten as they
would sit around the bunk house and listen to
old King Cole strum the guitar that the platoon
had bought for him.</p>

<p>It was late in May, and the rains that had
marked the springtime had almost stopped. It
was evening, and a dull yellow moon soared
gracefully above shoals of white, vaguely formed
clouds. In the heavens the disk seemed like a
ship, rocking a trifle as it rose over a sea of
fluffy cotton.</p>

<p>Outside the bunk house members of the platoon
stretched full length on the thick, soft
grass, and listened to old King Cole pick tentatively
at the strings of his guitar.</p>

<p>“Play us somep’n’ sad an’ boozy, Humpy.”</p>

<p>“Naw, play ‘The Little Marine Went Sailing
Away.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give us ‘If I Had the Wings of an Angel.’”</p>

<p>“Can’t play nothin’ without a drink,” King
Cole informed the group. “Now, if I was back
in Muskogee to-night I’d go in M’Gittis’s saloon
and say ‘Fill ’em up agin, M’Gittis,’ all
night.... Ain’t nobody got a drink?” he
broke off plaintively.</p>

<p>“Well, I got a little wine you can have,
Humpy. It’s in my canteen.”</p>

<p>“Wine? You call that red hog-wash wine?
I like hooch, anyway.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“Go and git your damned old wine.” In the
evenings when there was no occupation for the
platoon, King Cole rated equally with President
Wilson.</p>

<p>The wine was brought and King Cole drank
well. He wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand, emitted a satisfied “Ah,” and began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Oh, meet me, oh, meet me, to-night, love,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Oh, meet me in the garden alone.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">For I’ve a sad story to tell you,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A story that’s never been told.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>King Cole solemnly chanted the last lines and
stopped.</p>

<p>“I can’t play no more. That damned wine
makes me dry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The conversation turned upon decent prostitutes
and honest gamblers, a discussion over
which Paul Kruger alone had taken the affirmative
every time.</p>

<p>“You betcha there can be decent gold-diggers.
And honest gamblers, too,” he was
saying.</p>

<p>“What’s so funny about that? They’re
nothing but ways of making a living.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, Paul,” one of the men interrupted,
“if a woman goes around and sleeps with everybody
she can’t be very decent, can she?”</p>

<p>“As decent as your damned society women
every time. Now look here. A woman gits
married. And then she leaves her husband.”
He stopped. “Got that? Well, she marries
another guy and then another. Now, how is
she any better than a regular gold-digger?”</p>

<p>“This ain’t <em>no</em> place to talk about things like
that. No place at all. You all bettah be
prayin’ to Gawd that this hyah wah’ll soon be
ovah,” said Pugh.</p>

<p>Mercifully, the officer of the day walked by
and ordered them off to bed.</p>

<p class="tb">On Decoration Day all of the units of the
regiment were marched to regimental headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and crowded upon the lawn in front of
the building occupied by the colonel and his
staff. After waiting perhaps an hour, the regimental
chaplain, pot-bellied, short-legged, and
wholly bald, addressed the soldiers. Vaguely
they comprehended that this was the day when
fallen heroes were to be especially revered, and
that it should also be a day of silent prayer and
commemoration for the souls of those who were
about to die. Half of the audience heard not
a word, and fully three-quarters of them would
not have been interested if they had.</p>

<p>The platoons filed out and marched over the
dusty road for several miles back to their quarters.
In some manner the commemoration address
of the regimental chaplain left the members
of the platoon gloomy. For a long while,
as they marched along, there was no sound save
for the muffled tramp of feet on the thickly dust-coated
road.</p>

<p>Finally Kahl ended the silence: “You know,
fellows, the regimental chaplain was right. All
of us haven’t so damned long to live.”</p>

<p>“Come out of it, you gloom bug.”</p>

<p>“Why do you care? you’ll be alive to spit on
all of our graves. You should worry.”</p>

<p>“By God, Kahl’s right. I was up at Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
P. C. night before last, and I heard some
old boy tellin’ Major Adams that we were goin’
back to the front pretty damn quick.”</p>

<p>“Pretty damn quick? I guess we are. The
battalion runner told me that we was shovin’
off for the front to-night,” Pugh contributed.</p>

<p>To all this conversation Goldman, a New
York Jew, who had given his occupation as a
travelling salesman, listened eagerly without
appearing especially to do so. His prominent,
fluid-brown eyes were turned upon Pugh, and
they continued furtively to watch him while he
spoke.</p>

<p>“You know, they say it’s hell up at the front
now. The Squareheads have busted through
and the Frogs are fallin’ back as fast as they
can. I betcha,” Pugh continued excitedly,
“that we’ll be up to the front in less than—in
less than a week.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, an’ they say they cut ya where you
don’ wanna be cut.”</p>

<p>“Pipe down, you men back there. Who gave
you permission to talk?” Sergeant Harriman
called.</p>

<p>“Who the hell gave you permission to give
us permission to talk?” some one indistinctly
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The platoon plodded along, their thoughts
too taken up with the matter at hand—arriving
at their quarters, being fed, and going to sleep—to
give further thought to the eventuality of
their being killed.</p>

<p>When they swung into their quarters, the
fumes of the concoction which they had cheerfully
and not inaccurately entitled “slum” were
apparent to them. It assaulted their nostrils,
but it was acceptable to empty stomachs.</p>

<p>They sat around; some were cross-legged on the
ground, others sat upon manure piles, with their
mess-gears half filled with slum by their sides.</p>

<p>Hicks and Pugh were seated together.</p>

<p>“What was that,” Hicks asked, “you were
saying about going to the front? Was that
just general orders from the head, or was it
straight?”</p>

<p>“Ah jist told you what I heard, Hicksy.
Some old guy told Major Adams that we’d be
gittin’ out of here damn quick. That’s all I
know. But say, it wouldn’t surprise me none
if we went any time. Even to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell, no. Not to-night. I’m too
damned tired to move. I’d go to the sick bay
if we shoved off to-night.” Hicks was despondent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Pugh shrugged his shoulders and once more
attacked his slum. A moment later the company
commander walked toward the place
where the men were eating. He was followed
by the first sergeant. He approached Harriman.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” he said, “have your platoon
make up their packs and stand by. Let no one
go to bed, and be ready to leave at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Sergeant Harriman.</p>

<p>“By God, Pugh, you were right, you uncanny
bitch. It’s to-night that we leave,” said Hicks.</p>

<p class="tb">Midnight. Long rubber ponchos were drawn
over recumbent figures; heads were pillowed
by packs; sleep remained impervious to Allied
propaganda. There was a tearing noise as
a rifle exploded.</p>

<p>The company commander came running out
of the farmhouse, where he and the other officers
lodged with the farmer and his family.
“What the devil are you men trying to do?”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s shot himself, captain.”</p>

<p>The first sergeant followed, bringing with him
an electric torch. He hurried to the place where
a group of men had gathered. Pushing through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he directed the rays of the torch toward the
body. It was Goldman. He had placed the
butt of the rifle on the ground, and with the
muzzle pressed against his throat, had forced
the trigger with his toe. There he lay, with
one shoe off and the blood streaming from a
hole in his jaw.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>The platoon assembled and joined the rest
of the company along the road. They
marched off in the darkness, melting in with
the immeasurable stream of olive drab that
grew at every cross-road.</p>

<p>Up and down the hills they marched, evenly
wearing away the distance that lay between
themselves and their destination. In the night
there were no directions, no cool and mysterious
little cafés to draw their attention from placing
one foot after the other. Marching at night,
Hicks thought, was much easier than marching
in the daytime, provided that it was not too
dark and the roads were not too slippery.
Everything was serene. And it remained so
until the man behind you stepped on your heel
or until a small, carnivorous louse, a yellow one
with a large black speck in the middle of its
back, commenced to crawl under your arm or
upon your chest. But after fifteen or twenty
kilometres, marching even at night was oppressive.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the millionth valley they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
passed through, lay the town. Along the road,
leading up the hill on the other side, horizon-blue
motor-trucks stood and waited.</p>

<p>The platoon came to a halt in one of the
streets, the butts of their rifles clattering on the
cobblestones. It had been quite dark a moment
ago, but dawn had come hurriedly, and
now Hicks could see the great number of troops
that were preparing to embark.</p>

<p>He turned to Lepere, a confessed virgin and
the only person in the platoon who boasted of
it. “It will be hours before our turn comes.
Let’s sneak off somewhere and lie down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Lepere decisively answered. “You
can’t tell how soon we’ll be called. And then
we may get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“You’ll probably get into trouble if you go
up to the front, too. You’d better go up to the
company commander and tell him you’re sick.”</p>

<p>Lepere failed to reply, and Hicks, glancing
around, noticed that the officers were not in
sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack.... Pugh. Let’s go find a hay-mow.”</p>

<p>“Oh-o, Hicksy’s gittin’ to be a wildcat. He
wants to leave his little platoon. All right,
come on, Hicksy.” Every time Pugh talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his voice reminded Hicks of a crippled professional
beggar.</p>

<p>They slipped off their packs, dropped them
at their feet, and dodged around a street corner.</p>

<p>No more than they had passed out of sight of
the platoon when Hicks exclaimed: “Well, I’m
damned. Old Fosbrook. Have you got a
drink?”</p>

<p>“Hello, William.” Fosbrook put out a hand
that was like a dead fish. “I’ve got a little rum.”</p>

<p>“Well, who wants anything better than rum?
Pugh, meet an old friend of mine, Raymond
Fosbrook. Fosbrook, this is Jack Pugh, the
best gambler in the regiment.”</p>

<p>“How do you do?” Fosbrook again produced
the clammy, insensible hand.</p>

<p>“What kind of a job have you got that you
can be traipsing around the streets like this
with a bottle of rum on your hip?” demanded
Hicks.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m the colonel’s interpreter. I order
the ham, eggs, drinks, and women for him.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad job,” Hicks admitted.
“Now, how about that?”</p>

<p>A full quart bottle was brought into view.
Fosbrook uncorked it and passed it around.
The bottle was passed around a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
times. Then it was thrown into the gutter,
empty.</p>

<p>“I tell you, William, and you, too, Mr. Pugh,
that we are going to see strange things before
very long. What would you say if I told you
that the Germans had broken through the
French lines and were headed for Paris?”</p>

<p>“I’d say,” said Pugh, “that I don’t wondah
a damn bit. Them damn Frogs is always
asleep. They’re too pretty to kill a mosquito.”</p>

<p>Fosbrook, taking hold of Hicks’s shoulder-strap
and holding it grimly, set his mouth
with firmness, and, with a full pause between
each word, said: “William, I mean it. There’s
going to be hell to pay in a few days.”</p>

<p>“Well, why are you worrying?” Hicks answered.
“You won’t be in any of it.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Hicksy, we’d better go.” People
were beginning to open the shutters of the
houses on either side of the street, and both
men began to wonder how long they had been
away from the platoon.</p>

<p>They hurried back, arriving just as the platoon
had started slowly to move forward.</p>

<p class="tb">No one seemed to have the least notion of
the direction in which the camions were moving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Though some of the men who had been
reading a recent copy of the Paris edition of
the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>, believed them to be headed
for the Somme, where, it was said, there was
heavy fighting; others believed that they were
on their way to relieve the First American Division,
which a few days earlier had attacked at
Cantigny. Apparently the trip was to last for
two or more days, for each squad had been apportioned
two days’ extra rations before entraining.
The drivers of the camions were Japanese,
which, as purveyors of information, made
them as useful as do many “professional” silent
men of the President’s cabinet. With twenty
men in each camion the train bumped and
thundered along the road all day. At night
they stopped only a few minutes to allow the
soldiers to prepare themselves for a still longer
journey.</p>

<p>Late the next afternoon they passed a city
which they decided was Meaux. The men in the
camions did not know where they were going,
but they did know that it was in the direction
of the front. In the town the streets were
crowded with wagons, carts, domestic animals,
and people. Comforters were thrown out over
the hard pavement, and families were lying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
them, resting. It seemed as if the entire city
was so filled with people that one other person
could not get in.</p>

<p>The camions hurried through, while the men
inside, leaning forward, shouted “couche” and
other words of which they did not know the
meaning whenever they saw any youngish
women.</p>

<p>Leaving Meaux, the spirit of attack already
seemed to be entering the men. Outside the
city they met an old man with a patriarchal
beard, seated upon his household goods, which
were piled upon a little cart driven by a mule.
Beside the cart walked a woman that might
have been either his wife or his daughter. The
old man looked as if he were crying. His mouth
was drawn back into a querulous pucker and
his hands rested limply in his lap.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, pappy. We’ll get your
home back for you,” called a voice from one of
the camions. The sentiment was taken up and
voiced by a great number. Through the warm
glow of the spirit of the crusader that it gave
them, all other emotions were submerged.</p>

<p>Mirrors in ornate frames apparently had a
special significance for the refugees. Not one
of them but had carefully salvaged his mirror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and was displaying it, safely bound to
the bedclothing with which the cart was loaded
down. Every one of the refugees seemed also
to have a large feather bed, and among the
property that they were carrying away from
their deserted homes was often to be noticed a
round glass cover under which was a wedding-cake
or a carved miniature of an old-fashioned
man and maid dancing a minuet.</p>

<p class="tb">It was night, and many of the men had gone
to sleep. The camions stopped abruptly, and
the awakened men, trying vainly to unlimber
their stiffened muscles, laboriously made their
way to the ground.</p>

<p>Hicks had been one of the first men to leave
the camion. Now he walked around in front
of it. Funny, there were no other camions before
him! He ran to the rear and down the
road a few paces. No camions there either.</p>

<p>“Hey, fellows! we’re lost.”</p>

<p>“Lost? And up here? What the hell are
we going to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t give a damn if we are lost. I need
a vacation, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Pipe down, damn it. You can’t tell how
near we are to the German lines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yeh, and that Jap might be a German spy.
We better watch out.”</p>

<p>They were still talking when Sergeant Ryan
arrived. He had left the truck when it stopped.
Walking ahead, he had found a deserted village.</p>

<p>“Well, fellahs. You better get down out of
there and come with me. There are plenty of
places to sleep right up ahead, and as it looks
like we’re lost, that’s what we’d better do.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Ryan always talked as if he were
about to chuckle. Ever since the platoon had
been formed Sergeant Ryan had been held up to
the entire company, and often to the battalion,
as the best-looking soldier readily to be found.
Even in the trenches his nails were manicured,
the nails of his long, sensitive fingers. His small,
pointed mustache looked as if it had been freshly
waxed. His puttees were rolled neatly about
his smart-looking legs. And he could drink all
night, and, to the eye, not be affected by it.</p>

<p>“We’ll foller Ryan any place, won’t we,
guys?”</p>

<p>“You’re damned right.”</p>

<p>They gathered together their equipment and
started after him down the road. It was a
very small town and had been evacuated two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
days before. No matter if the feather beds had
been taken away, there was plenty of dry hay
to sleep on.</p>

<p>Morning came and Sergeant Ryan was awake
and engaged in rousing the men. After they
had all been found, he assembled them on the
street and issued orders:</p>

<p>“Now you men can do what you please.
Only don’t break anything. We are going to
stay here until somebody comes for us. There
ought to be plenty of food around, and you
ought to know what to do.”</p>

<p>There was plenty of food. Young pullets
stalked temptingly before them, and young
Higgins, who heretofore had never distinguished
himself in any way, developed an uncanny aptitude
of snaring them with a swoop of his left
arm, clutching them neatly by the leg. Nearly
all of the cellars were stored with potatoes, and
wine was not uncommon.</p>

<p>Into a château which presumably belonged to
the overlord of the village the party carried
their food. The pullets had been prepared for
frying, potatoes were sizzling in a large kettle
of grease, a table had been laid with a crisp linen
cloth.</p>

<p>The party was seated around a large table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Upon the linen cloth were china plates and silver
knives and forks. In the centre were dishes
piled high with fried chicken and potatoes. A
salad brightened the menu. Wine-glasses and
tumblers were filled and dust-covered bottles
stood near at hand, ready to replenish them.</p>

<p>“This is what you might call the life of
Riley.” Sergeant Ryan spoke with his soft
voice that almost broke into a chuckle.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world. Jist like New York.”</p>

<p>“Gittin’ lost ain’t hard to take. Jist think
of the rest of the outfit, snappin’ into it whenever
Harriman opens his yap.”</p>

<p>The glasses were emptied and refilled. It
was a religious ceremony.</p>

<p>“Now if some of them dames we seen at
Meaux was up here.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Hicks started to laugh, long and
loudly.</p>

<p>“What you laughin’ at? Is there anything
funny in my wantin’ a little company? ’Course
these Frog gals ain’t as nice as....”</p>

<p>“No, no. It wasn’t that at all. But we
were going to save these people’s homes—and
now we’re killing their chickens.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be so damned finicky. This is
war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s right, Hicks.” Bullis nodded sagely.
“If we didn’t get it the Squareheads would.”</p>

<p>The party, all but Ryan, tilted back in their
chairs, their tunics unbuttoned and their belts
unfastened. Their eyes having proved larger
than their appetites, much of the food remained
on the table untouched. But there was room
in their bellies for wine, and bottle after bottle
was opened and emptied.</p>

<p>“There,” said Bullis, pointing to an empty
bottle, “is a good soldier. He has done his
duty and he is willing to do it again.”</p>

<p>Foolishly, the men raised their hands to their
forehead in a gesture of homage.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>They lurched out into the street. The day
was hot and still, and the men, exhilarated
by the wine and satiated with the food,
were planning for other banquets as sumptuous.
Around the corner of the crooked street
marched an orderly, wearing his inevitable look
of having the responsibility of the war on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Are you men from C Company of the
Sixth?”</p>

<p>“You’re damned right we are, buddy. Have
you got anything to say about it?”</p>

<p>“No. Only you’d better hurry up and join
them or you’ll be up for a shoot for desertion.”</p>

<p>“Why, whaddya mean? Where are they?”
Several men spoke at once.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the orderly importantly, “they
were getting ready to go over the top when I
left.”</p>

<p>“Great Christ!” Ryan lamented. “We’d
better hurry. Lead the way, orderly.”</p>

<p>Flanked by rows of waving wheat, the party
plodded along the dusty, narrow road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now we are in it for sure,” Hicks thought.
“And me especially. If Major Adams hears
about this I’ll be hung higher than a kite.”
But he forgot the possibility of a court martial
in his thinking of the platoon and of where they
were and of where he was soon to be.</p>

<p>The platoon was found in a clump of woods,
a little to the left of the road. In front of them
was the spectacle of what a French village
looked like after it had been subjected to long-range
artillery fire for three days. The spire of
the inevitable little church had been blown off;
there was not a house or barn whose side or
roof had not been pierced by a shell. Mortar
and glass were strewn about the streets, where
they mingled with articles of household use.
Beside the door of one of the houses a Red
Cross flag had been fastened, and inside the
medical detachment were making preparations
for visitors.</p>

<p>Old King Cole sat hunched up, his helmet
over his eyes, looking down at his heavy shoes.
Kahl, a light-weight boxer from Pennsylvania,
was attacking a tin of corned beef, trying to
open it with his bayonet. Wormrath, from
Cleveland, who carried a khaki-colored handkerchief
which he had used for three months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sat with his arms around his knees, his eyes
looking far away and moist.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, King?” Hicks called,
anxious somehow to make himself again a part
of the platoon as soon as he could.</p>

<p>“Oh, this damned war makes me sick. Always
movin’ around. They never let you stay
one place a minute.”</p>

<p>“Join the marines and see the world,” some
one called.</p>

<p>“Through the door of a box car,” some one
else amended.</p>

<p>“You’ll be up here long enough, old fellow.
You ought to come from my part of the country,
King. They do a lot of cutting and shooting
there.”</p>

<p>“Yeh.” King Cole was ironic. “They do a
lot of cuttin’ and shootin’. They cut around
the corner and shoot for home.”</p>

<p>Kahl laughed exultantly. He felt that at
last the time he had given to training was to be
of some purpose. He abandoned trying to open
the tin of meat because he feared that he would
dull his bayonet. And he wanted it to be
sharp, so sharp. Those dirty Huns. He drew
his finger along the edge of the shiny piece
of steel. That would cut, all right. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wouldn’t be deflected by a coat-button from
piercing the intestines.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford, bent forward as usual,
the end of his nose wiggling nervously, came
among them with Sergeants Ryan and Harriman.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any smoking or any matches
lighted after dark to-night, fellows. We are
only about a mile from the German front line.
As near as I can make out they are advancing
and it is our job to stop them. We’ll probably
move forward some time after dark, so have
your stuff by your side.”</p>

<p>“When do we eat? Won’t we get any chow
all night?”</p>

<p>“The galley is in the town back of us. They
are cooking up some slum, and it ought to be
brought up here pretty soon.” He walked
away.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like a good kick in the face
to make you forget your little troubles.” Bullis
summed up the feeling of the platoon.</p>

<p>Kahl, industriously, was working the bolt
of his rifle back and forth, pouring drops
of oil in the chamber and upon the lock. He
leaned toward Hicks and remarked in an undertone:
“Hicks, old fellow, if Kitty Kahl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
doesn’t earn a Croix de Guerre to-morrow his
mother will be without a son.”</p>

<p>“What do you want one of those things for,
Kahl? You can buy ’em for five francs.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t earn one of them with five
francs.”</p>

<p>“But what do you want with one of them?
What good are they?”</p>

<p>Hicks, perhaps, was insincere. One might
want a decoration and be delighted to have it,
but intentionally to go after it appealed to him
in the light of absurdity.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Bedford departed, each man
drew inside himself. Merely to observe them,
one would have believed that they were concerned
with profound thoughts. A Y. M. C. A.
secretary would have told himself that the men
were thinking of their homes and families, praying
to God, and the Y. M. C. A. General
Pershing would have charged them with possessing
a fierce, burning desire to exterminate the
Germans. The regimental chaplain—he had
come to the regiment from an Episcopal pulpit—would
have said that they were capitulating
their sins and supplicating God for mercy.</p>

<p>While it was yet light Sergeants Harriman
and Ryan and Lieutenant Bedford discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
aloud the plans that had been tentatively given
them for the night, but as objects in their line
of vision lost their distinctness and became
vague, mysterious figures, they lowered their
voices to a whisper. Lieutenant Bedford peered
at his wrist-watch.</p>

<p>“It’s time to go. Better break out the men,
Harriman.” Sergeant Harriman crept along
the road to the clump of woods where the platoon
was huddled.</p>

<p>“All right, men,” he whispered hoarsely; “it’s
time to shove off. Has everybody got his
trench tools?”</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my shovel.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean you, Gillespie. You’d lose
your head if it wasn’t fastened on. Is any one
missing any of their equipment?”</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>“All right. Form in a column of twos and
follow me.” Sergeant Harriman started off,
and the men, who had risen, fell in behind
him.</p>

<p>Until this time all had been quiet, but now
the machine-guns, unmistakably Maxims, began
an intermittent fire. It seemed to be a signal
for the rifles, for now and again one of them
would crack pungently somewhere in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The platoon was marching cautiously over
the hill to the town in front of them.</p>

<p>“Stand fast!” Sergeant Ryan called out
sharply. A rocket was fired, rose high in the
air, and then, the parachute spreading out,
floated slowly to earth, lighting up the ground
for several hundreds of yards on each side. As
soon as it had reached the ground the platoon
marched on. They passed through the town,
and, as they were leaving, a covey of shells
whirred softly over their heads and landed
among the ruins with a terrific explosion. The
remaining walls seemed to reverberate. It
sounded as if they were rocking back and forth
from the concussion.</p>

<p>At the military crest of the hill the platoon
stopped, joined on its left by the rest of the
company. The company commander walked
along the line, repeating, so that each man could
hear: “You’ll have to hurry and dig in, men.
It’s three hours until dawn, and if you haven’t
got yourselves a place of safety by that time
you will be unfortunate.”</p>

<p>The men threw off their packs, unstrapped
their trench tools, and set to work to make holes
in the ground sufficiently deep to protect their
bodies from rifle fire and from pieces of flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
shell. As there were only four men in each
squad equipped with trench tools, the other half
commenced digging with their bayonets and
scraping the dirt from the hole that they were
making with the lid of their mess gear. But
they worked furiously, and with the aid of the
company commander and all of the subofficers,
which consisted in telling them that they
had just so much longer until dawn, each pair
of men had made for themselves a hole in the
ground from which they could manipulate their
rifles without exposing their bodies to direct
fire.</p>

<p>When dawn broke the company presented to
the enemy a slightly curved front of newly made
holes, with the dirt thrown up in front of them
for further protection.</p>

<p>Across the valley, perhaps five hundred yards,
was a thickly wooded hill, from which, as the
light strengthened, the platoon could see figures
running out into the field and then back again
among the trees. Then, to the right, the
Hotchkiss machine-guns began their wavering
patter.</p>

<p>From another woods, in front and to the left
of the platoon, ran soldiers in frayed and dirty
horizon-blue uniforms. Harriman pointed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the wooded hill where the scurrying figures had
been seen. “Boche?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oui, Boche,” the men in the soiled uniforms
answered.</p>

<p>“Boche, Paris?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“Oui.” The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.
“Ce ne fait rien.”</p>

<p>Doubtless the Frenchmen, Hicks thought, did
not care; for seven days they had been forced
to fall back, slowly and with heavy losses.
There was little opportunity for sleep; and food,
despite the conscientious efforts of the French
cooks, was difficult to procure. They felt
beaten.</p>

<p>Another group of French soldiers hurried out
of the woods, and, as the others had done,
disappeared through the ruins of the village.</p>

<p>It was quite light now, and the German artillery
awoke. The first salvo of shells struck
in the town. The second fell in the field to the
right of the village.</p>

<p>Overhead the wings of an airplane whirred.
Under its wings were painted large black crosses.
It fired a signal, rose again in the air, wheeled,
and flew back.</p>

<p>“Duck your heads,” shouted Sergeant Ryan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pulling a cigarette from his pocket. “They’ve
got our range for sure.”</p>

<p>They had. A moment later and a number of
shells began a leisurely journey in the direction
of the platoon. As they approached they lost
their tardiness and fell shrieking, like some
maddened demons, along the line of freshly dug
dirt.</p>

<p>“Anybody get hit?” Sergeant Ryan rose
and looked around.</p>

<p>“Stretcher bearer on the right!” Hicks yelled.</p>

<p>In the hole next to his a curious thing had
happened. A shell had grazed the top of the
hole, buried itself in the dirt, and then backfired.
When the stretcher-bearers arrived they
found that Hayes, one of the men in the hole,
had part of his back torn off. Quickly they laid
him prone on the stretcher and started for the
town as swiftly as the weight of their burden
would permit. The other man, Hartman, was
still crouched in the position he had assumed
when Sergeant Ryan called the warning.</p>

<p>Hicks jumped over beside him. “Hartman,”
he called. Hartman failed to respond. He put
his arm around him and lifted him up. Hartman
began to laugh horribly. Then great tears
coursed through the mud on his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hartman, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Hartman laughed again in the same manner.
He had completely lost control of his muscles
and would have fallen face downward if Hicks
had not held him up.</p>

<p>“Tell Lieutenant Bedford that there’s something
the matter with Hartman,” Hicks
shouted.</p>

<p>The word was passed along.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Bedford says for you to get
somebody else and take him back to the first-aid
station. He’s probably shell-shocked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gillespie,” Hicks called. “Come and
help me take Hartman back to the first-aid
station.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hicks, I can’t. I’m sick at my stomach.
I couldn’t help carry anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pugh—come on, Pugh, you help
me.”</p>

<p>And Pugh got out of his hole, a few yards
away, and ran over. Both men, one holding
his legs and the other his shoulders, tried to
dodge the stream of machine-gun bullets as
they hurried the shell-shocked man to the
dressing station.</p>

<p>In the village there was greater safety—cellars
to hide in, and there to escape the flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
pieces of shells that fell into the town at short
intervals.</p>

<p>Hicks and Pugh rested for a moment, filled
their canteens with water, and started back.
Half-way to the platoon they found a Frenchman
lying upon his back.</p>

<p>“À moi, à moi,” he was groaning scarcely
above a whisper.</p>

<p>“What’s the mattah, buddy,” Pugh asked.</p>

<p>“ ... par le gaz ... par le gaz.”</p>

<p>“He says he’s been gassed, Pugh. Let’s take
him back, too.”</p>

<p>“Here, buddy, do you want a drink of
watah?” Pugh asked.</p>

<p>The Frenchman drank greedily.</p>

<p>“By God,” Pugh said, “that’s the first Frog
I’ve ever seen that would drink water.”</p>

<p>They carried him to the dressing station, and
after they had explained to the captain of the
Medical Corps where they had found him, in
what a desperate condition he was, and that
there was nothing else to do with him, the
Frenchman was finally accepted.</p>

<p>“We can’t fill this place up with all kinds of
people,” the medical officer objected. “We’ll
have a hard-enough time taking care of our own
men in a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Pugh, disgusted, emitted a stream of tobacco
juice, shrugged his shoulder, turned on his heel.</p>

<p>“Come on, Hicksy, let’s get back where
there’s white men.”</p>

<p>Their hearts racing madly, they reached their
holes without being struck by the machine-gun
bullets that sang deadly songs all around.
After the first terrific salvo, the German artillery,
for some unknown reason, had stopped.</p>

<p>The skirmishing on the right, which the platoon
had witnessed in the early morning, seemed
to have been carried within the woods. A few
waves of pigmy-like figures had walked slowly
toward the wooded hill, and by the time their
lines arrived, although considerably thinned,
the gray defenders of the hill were to be seen
no more.</p>

<p>Now that they were no longer targets, Hicks
walked over to where Ryan was squatted in his
hole.</p>

<p>“This is a hell of a note, isn’t it, Ryan? To
have to lie like this all day and not get to fire
a shot?”</p>

<p>“You’ll get a chance to fire plenty of shots,
damn it. Some poor fool is making our regiment
attack without a barrage. Did you see
the outfit over on the right that went up that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hill? That was the third battalion, and I’ll
bet there’s not a third of the men left. Well,
we’ll go over most any time.”</p>

<p>“But, Ryan, that’s murder, not to have a
barrage. What can these fool officers be thinking
of?”</p>

<p>“Glory,” Ryan answered.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the company commander
passed the word along the line that the
men would be permitted to eat one of their
boxes of hard bread, but nothing else.</p>

<p>“Who the hell wants to eat any of that
damned stuff?”</p>

<p>“God, my hardtack laid in the trenches for
six weeks, and even them damned rats wouldn’t
eat it.”</p>

<p>The platoon had recovered its spirits, its
“morale,” as the white-collared fighters for
democracy often spoke of it.</p>

<p class="tb">As night was coming on, a noise was heard
in the grass between the men and the ruined
village. It coughed tentatively, then decisively.</p>

<p>“Who’s back there?”</p>

<p>“A runner from battalion headquarters,” the
voice answered cautiously. “Don’t shoot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“What the hell are you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“We’re not as fierce as we look.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your company commander?” the
voice asked.</p>

<p>“He went over to ask the Squareheads to
stop shootin’. There’s a man here that’s got
a headache,” Pugh informed the voice.</p>

<p>“No, where is he, fellows?” By this time
the voice had become Fosbrook. Hicks recognized
him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fosbrook.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Fosbrook walked over to Hicks’s
hole and jumped in. “Hello, William.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here? I thought you
were interpreter for the colonel.”</p>

<p>“I was, William, but I drank too much one
night and he fired me,” Fosbrook answered
sadly.</p>

<p>“What do you want with the company commander?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I should tell you.”</p>

<p>“Hell, I’ll find it out in a minute, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, your company is to move to another
position as soon as it gets dark enough.”</p>

<p>“What for? Are we going to attack?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, William, I’m sure. Where is
your captain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s over between the third and second
platoons, about fifteen holes down that way.”</p>

<p>Fosbrook got up, and, stooping over until his
head was parallel with his hips, trotted in the
direction Hicks had indicated.</p>

<p>An hour later the orders came for the men
to sling their packs and be ready to move again.
And great was the outcry when the men heard
the news.</p>

<p>“Are we going to dig up the whole of
France?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get my old man to buy some ploughs
if we are. I wasn’t cut out to be a ditch
digger.”</p>

<p>“This is a hell of a note. Diggin’ a hole for
one day. I was jist gittin’ mine so’s I could
sleep in it.”</p>

<p>The company lined up in single file and
marched off.</p>

<p class="tb">After manœuvring around for a couple of
hours they came to another woods. On the
way they had been joined by a section of the
machine-gun company that was attached to
their battalion. In a measure, this annexation
was responsible for their slow progress. There
were the carts to be hidden, and then the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the machine-gun detail carried their guns and
their ammunition in their arms. But they were
halted at last, and amid much muttering and
cursing were shooed into the woods and told
that they might go to sleep for the night.</p>

<p>It was noon of the next day before they received
any food. Then a detail had to be
sent back to the village after it. And when
they returned they brought with them cold
boiled potatoes, cold coffee, and black French
bread.</p>

<p>“Don’t eat too many of these damned potatoes,”
Pugh warned all and sundry. “I was
ridin’ on a box car for three days once, and I
didn’t have nothin’ but these things to eat, an’
I got col’ sores all over my mouth.”</p>

<p>Cigarettes were scarce, so the butts of them
were passed around and in that way shared by
all.</p>

<p>The firing during the day was slight. Scattered
rifle fire was heard on both sides, but the
artillery was dumb. The men spent the day
speculating upon whether their own artillery
would arrive and get into position before they
were ordered to attack.</p>

<p>Time after time Kahl nervously paced the
length of the woods. He had done all that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
could to his rifle. The bolt worked smoothly
with a satisfying “click.” The bore had been
swabbed free of the oil, which had been put
there to keep the metal from rusting. The
chamber held five meticulously clean shells and
there was one in the bore.</p>

<p>Lepere and Harriman were telling each other
of what they used to do “on the outside,” by
which phrase they meant before they had enlisted.
Ryan was cursing because there was no
water to be had. His canteen was half empty,
and he knew better than not to hoard water.
He decided that he would have to shave without
water, and this angered him still more.
Then he divided the water equally, using a portion
for lather.</p>

<p>Thus they passed the day.</p>

<p class="tb">To the weary platoon, their thinned ranks
huddled all day long in the small clump of
woods, night came on slowly and inexorably.
The sun had disappeared, and, one by one, elf-like
stars became apparent, twinkling like shaking
jewels through the black curtain of the
heavens. At sunset orders had been received
for the platoon to be prepared to leave at any
moment. Their rifles were lying by their sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the men were sprawled on the damp ground,
their heads resting on their combat packs.</p>

<p>Some one touched a lighted match to a cigarette.
It glowed softly in the darkness, a
bright, inquisitive eye.</p>

<p>“Put out that God-damned light,” Lieutenant
Bedford whispered hoarsely. “Do you want
us all to get shot up?”</p>

<p>Soon at the edge of the woods the branches
were parted and a tense voice called: “Where is
Lieutenant Bedford?”</p>

<p>It was a messenger from battalion headquarters
carrying orders for the platoon to move.
The summons was passed along from squad to
squad, a disagreeable secret hurriedly disposed
of. The men slung their packs and, holding
their rifles in front of them, filed slowly and
carefully out of the woods to form in a column
of twos.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford in front and Sergeant
Ryan in rear—as if, Hicks thought, some of the
men were thinking of deserting—the men
marched off, joining the other platoons in the
middle of the field. Lieutenant Bedford called:</p>

<p>“Pass the word along to keep quiet; we’re
within hearing distance of the front lines.”</p>

<p>On both sides the artillery was silent. Occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a machine-gun would fire a string of
bullets the sound of which died in the stillness
without an echo.</p>

<p>The platoon dragged slowly on, their legs
soaked around the knees from the dew nestling
on the tall wheat. For perhaps a mile they had
marched, and the platoon, like a sensitive instrument,
was beginning to have an unaccountable
perception of danger, when shoes were
heard swishing through the heavy wheat, and a
voice said:</p>

<p>“Turn around, you damned fools. Do you
want to walk straight into the German
trenches!”</p>

<p>The men breathed relievedly. Apparently
they were not going immediately to attack.
Recovering, they began audibly to curse the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“The dirty German spy. What the hell does
he think he’s doin’?”</p>

<p>“Ought to be back at G. H. Q. with the rest
of the dummies.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant, unable to distinguish the
mumbling voices as belonging to any particular
persons, vowed to himself that when the platoon
was relieved and back in a rest camp, he would
give them extra fatigue duty for a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>They were coming to another woods, and
within a few yards of its fringes some officers
stepped out and halted them.</p>

<p>“All right, here you are.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, swing your men right in here
and don’t let any one get out of the woods.”</p>

<p>The men backed in among the trees and lay
down, their packs, raising their shoulders from
the ground, protecting them from the moisture.
They lay silent, with their rifles cradled in their
arms. No one seemed to mind the wet of the
grass or the chill of the air. They were all
silent and rather full of fear. Time was unknown.
They might have been there a year—a
minute—an æon.</p>

<p>Just as the trees, in a clump of woods, perhaps
a mile away, were beginning to come out
against the sluggish sky like sharp, delicate
etchings, the batteries awoke. After the first
flock of shells, sounding like black, screaming
spirits, were fired, the men in the woods were
fully aroused and many of them were standing.</p>

<p>“Uh-h-h, did you hear that bunch of sandbags?”</p>

<p>“They sounded as if they came from a thousand
miles.”</p>

<p>Another salvo was fired, the shells droning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
lazily over the heads of the men and crashing
terrifically more than a mile distant.</p>

<p>And then the smaller guns were unlimbered.
The spiteful crack of the seventy-fives turned
the funereal music into a scherzo. In retaliation
the German batteries, the heavier ones,
began, their shells flying high overhead.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford jumped up. “All right,
Third Platoon. Up you come. Keep straight
ahead and remember your three-yard interval.
If any one gets hit, let him lie.” And then, as
if he were uncertain, as if he wanted to convince
himself of the actuality of the words he
had just spoken, he added: “Those are the
orders.”</p>

<p>“I always knew they hated the Third,” said
Lepere, “but blamed if I knew they hated our
guts so much that they put us in the first wave.”</p>

<p>But Kahl only grinned. He was conscious of
a feeling as if his face had become frozen and
as if his chin were about to drop off. It hung
slackly and his teeth came unnaturally together
when he clinched his jaws. He tightened
the chin-strap of his helmet, guarding
against the chance of losing his chin. Next,
his feet felt so awfully heavy. They would
barely permit themselves to be lifted from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ground. They had become separate identities,
and as he became conscious of them he felt
them to be unfamiliar.</p>

<p>“Damn this mud,” he told himself, though
knowing well that there was no mud weighing
down his feet.</p>

<p>After pounding away for fifteen minutes, the
smaller artillery stopped. The whistle blew
and the men advanced, stepping out in the open
where the risen sun made them hideously
conspicuous. The field separating the woods
stretched far on either side, and was covered
with green-stemmed wheat that reached hip-high.</p>

<p>Kahl, glancing over his shoulder, saw the
rays of the sun flashing from the clean bayonets,
the bayonets the men so often had jabbed
into sacks of sand and straw.</p>

<p>The sergeant in charge of the first wave set
the pace, which was frightfully slow. Somewhere,
farther down the line, men began to object
to the snail-like progress.</p>

<p>“Yes,” thought Kahl, “it’s amusing that we
walk so slowly when we are right out in plain
sight.” It struck him as odd that the line was
not being fired upon, and then he explained it
to himself by the notion that the heavy barrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
had driven the enemy back. But what if
it hadn’t—what if the Germans are just waiting
until we get right almost into the woods.
Wouldn’t that be a mess! And what a bore,
this moping through the wet smoky wheat. He
wondered whether his knees were bleeding.
Curse it! His neck was stiff. Maybe he could
limber it up if he shook his head.... No, it
couldn’t be done. It didn’t work.</p>

<p>The first wave entered the woods where the
enemy was without firing a shot or being fired
at. The second wave entered, and the third,
and the fourth.</p>

<p>Kahl, parting the leaves with his bayonet,
unexpectedly looked out upon a clearing, and
the sight he saw made him exclaim to the man
next to him:</p>

<p>“Oh, Jimmy, this must be some joke. Look
at all those fellows asleep there.”</p>

<p>In the clearing, lying flat on their backs, were
five soldiers, their legs stretched out. They
wore no shoes over their heavy woollen hose.</p>

<p>Hicks drew over toward him and looked.</p>

<p>“You better get down, you lumphead,” Hicks
cautioned; “they aren’t asleep.”</p>

<p>Together they crawled out toward the motionless
figures. By this time Lepere, Cole, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Pietrzak had come to the clearing and started
to follow.</p>

<p>“Je-sus, Kahl! Here’s a fellow out of the
Eighty-third Company that I enlisted with.
And he’s dead as hell.”</p>

<p>Rat-t-t-t——</p>

<p>It was a Maxim and the men dropped to their
bellies.</p>

<p>“Hey, you poor fool, can’t you shut up?”
Kahl said. “That’s a Maxim.”</p>

<p>Hicks made for behind a tree as fast as he
could crawl.</p>

<p>“Hey, Pete,” he called in an undertone
“where’s the rest of the outfit?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Pietrzak answered him.
“That’s the reason we come over here where
you fellers are.”</p>

<p>Hicks turned to Kahl. “By God, Kahl,
we’re lost!”</p>

<p>The machine-gun bullets shaved the bark
from the trunk of the tree behind which Hicks
was lying. He flattened out, his face pressed
into the grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kahl, we’re lost!”</p>

<p>But Kahl did not hear him. Possibly he
remembered what he had said earlier in the day.
Possibly he was really a hero. Possibly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
again saw himself as a little boy playing Indian
in the back yard. Whatever were his thoughts,
he rose to one knee, and, after peering intently
in the direction from which the bullets had
come, he raised his rifle to his shoulder and
sighted along the shining barrel.</p>

<p>Rat-t-t-t-tat.</p>

<p>A Maxim, but from an oblique direction, was
firing, and Kahl sprawled on his face, his right
arm falling over the shiny barrel of his rifle.
Then other machine-guns rained their bullets
into the clearing, and the men clawed at the
ground in an effort to lower their bodies beneath
the sweep of the lead.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do, Hicks?” asked Pietrzak.</p>

<p>The tender green leaves from the trunk of
the tree behind which Hicks was secure fluttered
to the ground, clipped by the machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but we can’t stay here. Why
don’t you find the rest of the gang?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well....” Hicks started to crawl back
from the clearing into the woods. After he had
wriggled his body about fifty yards he rose to
his feet and ran in the general direction of which
he had last seen the company. Breaking
through the woods, he met Captain Powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Captain Powers, there’s a squad of us up
there, and we’re lost. We don’t know what to
do. The men are in a clearing, and they’re
afraid to move because they’re right in sight of
a nest of machine-guns. Do you know where
the platoon is? What shall we do?”</p>

<p>And in a Shakespearian voice Captain Powers
told Hicks to return to his squad and lead
them in a charge on the machine-gun nest.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.” Hicks turned and squirmed
back through the woods to the clearing. “Like
hell we’ll advance,” he thought. “The poor
fool.”</p>

<p>Hicks reached the clearing at the same
time the German machine-guns momentarily
stopped.</p>

<p>“Ja find ’em, Hicks?”</p>

<p>“No, but I saw Powers. If we made a half
circle back to the left we might find ’em.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good enough to try.”</p>

<p>They were crawling, crawling on their bellies,
in single file, when Pugh stopped and
called with an exultant lilt in his voice:</p>

<p>“Oh-o, here’s one Squarehead that’s kissed
his papa good-by. Right through the eye.”</p>

<p>The men in rear veered off so as not to see
the dead body. A short distance away some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
one was moaning weakly. Hicks stopped.
“Another one of our guys hit, I betcha.”</p>

<p>They crawled eagerly and yet fearfully
toward the noises. Seen through the trees
bandy-legged Funk was supporting the head of
little Halvorsen and trying to get him to open
his eyes. Beside him was Lieutenant Bedford,
saying:</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, Funk. The kid’s gone, but
we’ll see if anything can be done.”</p>

<p>Funk was softly calling: “Hank, oh, Hank,
ain’t you got anything to say?”</p>

<p>Hicks got to his feet and came beside the
group that was staring at the dead face of Halvorsen.</p>

<p>“What’s that? Little Hank get it? Je’s,
that’s bad.”</p>

<p>And Pugh: “Poor little fellah. I give him a
hunnerd francs the other day. But he sure is
welcome to it.”</p>

<p>Funk straightened his body, letting the head
of Halvorsen touch the ground. Clinching his
fist, he raised it above his head and shook it
toward the woods: “We’ll get you, you dirty—”
He could not find the word with which he
wanted to characterize the inhumanity of the
Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Bedford grasped at his arm: “Get down, you
damned fool. Do you want to get hit, too?”</p>

<p class="tb">The platoon had begun the advance through
the woods in good order, but after it had
reached the more dense part the German machine-guns
commenced firing and four men fell.
They tramped on, unable to see the enemy.
Suddenly they realized that they had broken
contact between themselves and the platoon on
their left. Advancing, they wedged themselves
into the German lines and made a target for enfillade
fire. Then, little more to be done except
get killed, they halted.</p>

<p>An orderly from battalion headquarters
crawling through the woods carried with him
the information for Captain Powers that the
company was to intrench for the night. When
the news reached them the platoon failed even
to comment. For once their garrulous selves
were stilled. The realization that they were to
spend a night freighted with experiences totally
new, that through the darkness they were to lie
powerless to defend themselves, stunned them.</p>

<p>A curving line was described by Lieutenant
Bedford, and the men were deployed along it
at intervals. They unslung their packs, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
extra bandoliers of ammunition, and began furiously
to dig holes in the ground, deep enough
for them to lie in without exposing their bodies.
Some used their hand shovels and picks, while
others, more careless with their equipment,
used their bayonets to loosen the dirt and their
mess-kit lids to scoop it out.</p>

<p>Dusk, like powder of old blue, sifted through
the trees and wrapped the shallow burrows in a
friendly mystery. In their fresh-made beds,
peeping through the boughs with which they
had covered the tops of their holes, the men
waited.</p>

<p class="tb">Through the long night that stretched interminably
before them they peered into the darkness,
fancying, as they had in the trenches, that
each tree trunk was an enemy. The least noise
was sufficient for overworked nerves to press the
trigger of a rifle and send a volley of bullets
through the leaves of the trees. The calling of
a frightened bird would cause their hearts to
throb violently against their ribs. When they
spoke it was in the smallest of whispers, and
even so conversation was peculiarly lacking.</p>

<p>Hicks, at times, would think of a letter that
his mother had written him in which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
offered to send him a quantity of cyanide of
potassium. “You know, son,” she had written,
“this war is not like the war that grandpapa
used to tell you about. Those frightful
Germans have liquid fire and deadly gases, and
it is only when I think of how you would suffer
if you were burned by their infernal liquid fire
that I offer to send it. If you want it, just
mark a cross at the bottom of your next letter.”
But Hicks had not marked any cross. He had
laughed at the notion at first, and then, as the
months slipped by, he had forgotten entirely
about it. Now he wondered if he had done
wisely. Suppose he were shot like the fellow
in the trench the other day? Or gassed as
badly as the Frenchman whom he and Pugh
had carried back to the first-aid station. Yes,
it would have been comforting.... But he
revolted at the thought of poisoning himself.
His early religion had been that a suicide does
not better his condition. He simply lives in
purgatory. It would be hellish to lie gasping
forever in purgatory, Hicks thought. Dear old
mother. How she had cried when he told her
that he had enlisted and was to be sent almost
immediately to France. “But, mother, you
were such a good patriot before I enlisted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
now you don’t want me to go. What kind of
patriotism is that?” he remembered having
asked her. And how badly she had felt that
he only spent an hour with her before he left
for the training camp.</p>

<p>He was amused at the notion of digging holes
to lie in. It is insulting, he thought, to
ask a person to dig his own grave. It is barbaric.</p>

<p>The leaves of the trees were silvered above
by the rays of the sun playing upon the dew.
Morning had come.</p>

<p>Somewhere—and it seemed as if it were only
ten yards away, a bugle blew a short and unfamiliar
call.</p>

<p>“All right, Third Platoon!” Lieutenant
Bedford’s voice was hoarse with excitement.
“Forward, Third Platoon.”</p>

<p>Hesitatingly and half-whimpering, the platoon
climbed out from their holes, over which
they had carefully placed boughs of trees to
keep reconnoitering airplanes from seeing the
freshly dug dirt.</p>

<p>Hicks’s helmet felt as if it were about to come
off. It wabbled from one side to the other.
His face was frozen, and when he wanted to
speak out he felt that he could not because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
muscles that controlled his mouth refused to
respond. At first he was intensely aware of
his legs, but, surging along with the rest of the
platoon, he soon forgot them.</p>

<p>Three Germans were rising up in front of
him. “Don’t those queer little caps of theirs
look funny?” he thought, and, from the hip, he
fired his automatic rifle at them. One fell and
the others lifted their hands in the air and bellowed:
“Kamerad! Kamerad!” Hicks passed
by them, unheeding. More Germans. The
woods were filled with Germans. But the rest
of them wore heavy steel helmets that covered
their foreheads and ears.</p>

<p>“You dirty bastards!” Hicks heard some one
scream.</p>

<p>By God, he wouldn’t have any liquid fire
poured on him. “Johnston!” he called. But
Johnston, his leader, was not there. Hicks’s
last clip had been emptied of shells. There
were no more in his <i lang="fr">musette</i> bag. It wasn’t
possible! Johnston must be some place near,
ready to give him more clips. But no! He
threw his rifle away in disgust. A few yards
farther he saw the back of an olive-drab uniform,
and by one of the hands that was connected
to the uniform was clutched a rifle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Hicks snatched the rifle, unbuckled the cartridge-belt
from the uniform, and hurried blindly
on. A deep ravine was in front of him. He
half jumped, half stumbled across it, and found
himself once more in a wheat-field. There was
no one in sight. He scrambled back over the
ravine and through the woods again, frightened
but defiant. Wherever he looked, as he went
back through the woods, men were lying. Some
of them lay quite still. Others moaned and
cried alternately. But Hicks paid no heed.
He was still hurrying on, his head up and his
nostrils wide, when some one called:</p>

<p>“Here, Hicks, get busy and round up some
of these Squareheads.” It was Ryan.</p>

<p>Hicks felt as if he had been struck in the
stomach with a brick. He laughed nervously.
“Sure.”</p>

<p>Nine Germans stood together with their hands
raised high above their heads. Their knees
were shaking badly and they looked first to one
side and then to the other. Docile sheep, he
led them back to the village where he turned
them over to a reserve regiment.</p>

<p>On the way back to join his platoon he met
a man who looked familiar. “Say, fellow, don’t
you belong to A Company, of the Fifth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The man turned. “I did,” he said. “I
don’t believe there is any more A Company.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, we attacked this morning through an
open space in the woods,” the man told him.</p>

<p>“And they’re all dead? Fellah, I’ve got a
cousin in that outfit. Show me where they
went over.”</p>

<p>They walked back to the clearing together.
Men were lying around in all manner of postures,
and much more thickly than the men in
the woods.</p>

<p>“What was your cousin’s name, buddy?”</p>

<p>“Williams, Paul Williams,” Hicks jerked out.
“He was a tall, dark-haired fellow, about nineteen?”</p>

<p>“Nope. Might have seen him, but I don’t
remember his name.”</p>

<p>Hicks covered the entire field, stopping
closely to peer into the face of each of the men
who was not a German soldier. As he was
turning away from a man who was lying upon
his back, his arms and legs stretched wide, and
over whom he had stood longer than usual because
the face reminded him somewhat of his
cousin, the man’s eyelids partly opened, and in
a voice in which there was little strength, called:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
“Soldier! Oh, soldier! Don’t let that damned
Squarehead get me. Don’t leave me alone
with him. He’ll kill me.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t, buddy. He’s all right.”
Hicks spoke reassuringly. For a moment he
could not think whom the man was speaking
of, but then he recollected that a German Red
Cross attendant had been busy in the field,
binding the wounds of the soldiers. Hicks
looked around and saw the attendant a few
yards off. He beckoned to him, and tried to
illustrate by motions that he wanted the soldier
carried back to the first-aid station.</p>

<p>The German came over, lowered his head
to the soldier’s chest. “Nein. Caput.” He
pointed to a rust-colored spot on the soldier’s
tunic over the heart. While Hicks was standing
there, wondering what to do, the soldier’s
eyelids fluttered, he breathed once and deeply—and
died.</p>

<p>Hicks gave up hope of finding his cousin. He
had either been taken prisoner, and that was
not at all likely, or else he had been sent back
wounded, he thought.</p>

<p class="tb">Hicks tramped back through the thick woods
that suddenly had become quiet. The rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the noonday sun were filtering through the
boughs of the trees, seeking out the now inanimate
bodies, which would soon turn black and
bloat out of shape under the intense heat. Before
him, on a knoll of green, was a pile of heavy
boulders, and, peeping through a crevice, stuck
the nose of a Maxim. Climbing the knoll to
the right, he looked into the machine-gun nest.
Three bodies, motionless as the rocks themselves,
were stretched at length. One had fallen
face forward, an arm thrown over the stock of
the weapon. His back, that swelled under the
gray coat, was turned reproachfully toward the
sky. Another was sprawled on his back, his
hands and legs frozen in a gesture of complete
negation. His chin had fallen heavily on his
breast and upon his head his small trench cap
was tilted forward at a rakish angle. The other
man’s face was a clot of blood. Death, camera-like,
had caught and held him fast, his body
supported by the rocks, his face like a battered
sunflower in the evening.</p>

<p>Hicks stooped over and gently drew the
Maxim away from the man who had been firing
it when he had been killed. Shouldering it, and
carrying an extra belt of cartridges and the
water-cooler, he left the knoll and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
toward the ravine. The spectacle that he had
just witnessed left very little impression upon
him.</p>

<p>The platoon was gathered closely together in
the ravine. The ravine was deep and wide,
and every so often passage along it was obstructed
by a huge stone over which the men
would have to climb. Evidently, a few days
before, the French soldiers had used the ravine
as a trench from which to conceal themselves
while they fought against the onslaught of the
enemy. Little holes had been dug in the side
of the ravine nearest to the field in which men
could throw themselves to be protected from
the bursting shell casings and shrapnel. As he
approached, three of the men were scuffing
dirt over the body of a dead French soldier
who had fallen near one of the small burrows
in the ravine.</p>

<p>Sergeant Ryan was pacing along the ravine,
pulling at the ends of his pointed mustache.
Lieutenant Bedford, chewing speculatively at a
sprig of wheat, and Sergeant Harriman were
seated on the ground, apparently immersed in
a discussion.</p>

<p>Sergeant Ryan walked over to them.</p>

<p>“This is damned foolishness,” he called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“Before very long there are going to be so many
shells flying into this place that you won’t be
able to count them. And where will we be?
In hell, if we loaf around like this much longer.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford rubbed with the palm of
his hand the stubble on his pallid face. “If I
knew how much longer we were to be here,
Ryan, I would have had the men digging in
long ago.”</p>

<p>The company commander broke through the
edge of the woods, and stood on the edge of the
ravine. “Lieutenant Bedford. I want six of
your men right away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Bedford answered. “You, Hicks;
you, Cole; you, Bullis; you, Johnston; you, Lepere,
and Haight. Follow Captain Powers.”</p>

<p>Joined by details from the three other platoons,
the men followed along through the
woods again and out into a field which was very
near to the place where Hicks had searched for
Williams that morning.</p>

<p>“Have all of you men your rifles loaded?”</p>

<p>They responded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Well,” he hesitated, “you see that little
bunch of woods over there? There’s a number
of Germans there and we’re going after
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Swishing through the heavy wheat, the men
now advanced in skirmish order. They were
very cautious and, although the sun was making
a glaring light and they were directly in an
open field, they walked as though they were
sneaking toward the enemy. Captain Powers,
forgetting his impressive dignity, slunk along,
one shoulder low and his hand grasping by the
middle a rifle. His eyes were narrowed as if he
were registering for the motion-pictures “extreme
wariness.” As gently and softly as wading
through heavy grass permitted, Captain
Powers placed one foot after the other. His
manner infected the men. One by one they
adopted the crouching attitude, ready to spring
upon their unsuspecting prey. They could almost
be seen to flex the muscles in the calves of
their legs and in their upper arms, rising majestically
on their toes when they walked, instead
of using the customary flat-footed form of perambulation.</p>

<p>Captain Powers, abandoning his duties as instructor
of English at the Texas college, had
learned modern warfare from the books supplied
by the nearest officers’ training camp.
He had learned how to order men about, that
he was an officer and a gentleman, as the officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
who commissioned him had phrased it. But
yet he felt a slight interest in the men of his
command. In the officers’ training-school and
in the course of the practice skirmishes through
which he had been he had learned that the way
in which an attack was made by a small party
moving forward in full daylight was by running
forward in spurts until the objective had been
reached.</p>

<p>Being a professor of English, and especially a
professor of English in Texas, he sentimentalized
the attack. How much finer it is, he
thought, to attack as General Sam Houston
attacked; to march steadfastly upon the enemy
and make them surrender at the point of a sword
or a bowie-knife. The only rift came in his
realization that he had no sword, not even a
bowie-knife.</p>

<p>When the party was still several yards from
the edge of the woods, a mass of Germans, outnumbering
them twice, emerged with their
hands held high in the air and blithely calling:
“Kamerad.”</p>

<p>The captain’s disappointment at not being
able to make another attack worthy of a Texan
was soon lost in his exultant emotion at the
thought of the number of prisoners he had captured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Selecting one of the men to go with
him, he herded the prisoners back to the regimental
headquarters, where he proudly delivered
them to another officer.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>In the ravine Hicks was busy trying to place
his Maxim in a position from which it would
sweep a portion of the field. He had succeeded
in making it remain upright on its haunches,
and was now experimenting with it in various
positions, so that he could swing it back and
forth as he fired, and cover the maximum of
ground. The water-cooler had been set at its
side and the long rubber hose was attached to
the machine-gun. A belt filled with cartridges
was inserted in the chamber, and the affair was
ready to be fired.</p>

<p>“’At’s some gun you got there, Hicksy, old
boy. What do you ’spect to do with it? You
don’t aim to kill nobody, do you?” Pugh had
recovered and was in good humor. As he
talked, a black stubble of beard that grew grotesquely
on the chin of his elf-like face rose and
fell.</p>

<p>“No, Jack. I’m just keepin’ it for a souvenir.”</p>

<p>“Hell, y’ain’t got no souvenir. Lookit,
Hicksy.” He produced a small pearl-handled
pistol. “Got this offen one of them Dutchmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Lookit here.” He placed his hand in his blouse
and brought out a pair of field-glasses. “Got
this from another one. Now all I want to do is
to git wounded and I’ll take these babies back
and sell ’em for beaucoup francs to them S. O. S.
birds.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about getting wounded, Pugh,”
Harriman requested. “It’s bad luck. Remember
what Kitty Kahl said the other night?”</p>

<p>“Naw, how’d I know what Kitty Kahl said?
He didn’t say nothin’ to me.”</p>

<p>“He said that he’d either win a decoration or
get killed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he did. I want a bon-bless-ey
so I can git outta this damn hole.”</p>

<p>“Say, Hicks,” Lepere called, “you’d better
take down that confounded gun. The Boche
will see it and then we’ll all get killed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they won’t see it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell. One of their aviators is
liable to come over here any time.”</p>

<p>“Tyah tyah tyah tyah, you talk like you
come from where they have possums for yard
dogs, Lepeah,” Pugh sneered. “Hicksy, let’s
you and me go out salvagin’. There’s a lot of
salmon and stuff in some of them boys’ packs
that’ll never want it no more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean some of the fellows that have
been killed?” Hicks asked. “I don’t like to do
that. It seems too ghoulish.”</p>

<p>“I don’t cah what it seems like. I’m hawngry.
Le’s go.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Bedford’ll stop us.”</p>

<p>“Naw, he won’t. He’s too damned scared to
git out of his hole.”</p>

<p>They climbed out of the ravine and started
back through the woods.</p>

<p>“Hicksy! Be damned! Lookit that!”</p>

<p>“Where, where? What is it?”</p>

<p>“Look!” Pugh pointed his finger toward a
large tree. Its knees on the ground and its
forehead pressed stiffly against the bark of the
tree, a body kneeled.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back.”</p>

<p>“Naw, I wanta git some of that salmon.”</p>

<p>It was easy enough without touching the
bodies to collect armfuls of canned salmon from
the packs of the dead men. Soon they had all
they could carry. Besides the salmon, Pugh
had collected several razors and a carton of
talcum.</p>

<p>They had but reached the ravine when the
bottom seemed to drop from the sky, dumping
a deluge of shells. For a moment the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were stunned by the fierceness of the bombardment.
Hicks and Pugh emptied their arms of
the cans and dived for a burrow, reaching it
simultaneously. Another flock of shells struck
in and around the ravine. It was not until
after they had exploded that the report of their
having been fired was heard.</p>

<p>“Oh-o, Hicksy, can’t you get in a little closer
and give me some room,” Pugh yelled. “Them’s
the whizz-bangs they’ve been tellin’ us about.”</p>

<p>The shells, with their terrific “bz—BANG,
bz—BANG” poured in upon the men.</p>

<p>“Stretcher bearer on the left!” some one
screamed above the racket. The plea went unheeded.</p>

<p>“God damn it, there’s a man half killed up
there. Stretcher bearer on the le-f-f-t.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was anybody fool
enough to yell for one of them lousy stretcher
bearers. Hicksy, le’s you and me go up.”</p>

<p>While the shells fell and burst directly in
front of him, behind him, and on each side, a
huge fellow whose proportions made him an
easy target, walked conscientiously along the
ravine. In his hand was a bag containing first-aid
implements. To Hicks, as he passed, the
huge fellow, with the red cross on his arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
looked like a doting father who felt the necessity
forcibly to reprimand a child. A few minutes
later Hicks saw him, with the wounded
man thrown over his shoulder as if he were a
bag of salt, making his way along the ravine
and through the woods to the dressing station.</p>

<p>Bang—CRASH. The ravine reverberated
from the explosion. Another volley had been
hurled into it.</p>

<p>“Stretcher bearer on the left. Stretcher
bearer on the left,” some one called. From
time to time the cry was repeated, each time
less hopefully, more stridently.</p>

<p>Fiercely whining, a shell bore down upon the
ground under which Hicks and Pugh were
crouched. It landed softly. They waited,
breathless, for it to burst. Hicks was convulsed.
Oh, if only it would explode and end
the suspense. Hicks found himself wanting the
shell to burst, imploring it!</p>

<p>The smoke in the air was stifling them, burning
out their lungs. Their eyes were shot with
blood, and tears streamed unceasingly down
their cheeks. Their throats felt as if they had
swallowed handfuls of fine dust.</p>

<p>“I’ll choke, I’ll die,” Hicks thought with
every breath. He felt for his mask, knocked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his helmet, and adjusted the mask to his head.
Frenzied, he bit his teeth into the hard-rubber
mouthpiece, and breathed deeply. Oh, what a
relief; the picrine could not penetrate the chemicals
of the mask! He breathed again; gulped,
rather. Immediately his throat and lungs were
on fire. The mask was more of a hindrance
than a help.</p>

<p>Incomprehensibly, the bombardment stopped.</p>

<p>Men ran from their burrows and clambered
over the ravine in an effort to escape the blinding,
choking smoke.</p>

<p>“Stop, men,” Lieutenant Bedford called
hoarsely. “Come back here and be ready to
stand off an attack.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly they returned and placed themselves
in a position from which they could fire
across the field. Hicks drew out his canteen.
It was empty.</p>

<p>“Water, got any water, Pugh?”</p>

<p>“No, jist drained the last drop.”</p>

<p>Hicks walked down the ravine. “Anybody
got any water to spare?”</p>

<p>No one had. No one had any water. He
walked back beside Pugh. As he approached,
Pugh called:</p>

<p>“Oh, Hicksy, you’d better go over and ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
them Dutchmen for another gun. One of their
shells swiped that pretty one you had up
here.”</p>

<p>The Maxim which Hicks had diligently
striven to get into shape was gone—where, no
one knew.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. If they come over now I
wouldn’t have strength enough to pull a trigger.
I’m all in, Pugh.”</p>

<p>Fearfully the men waited for the attack. It
grew dark, but none came. Out in the field a
cow slowly moved across the broken ground.
In the dusk Lieutenant Bedford was stumbling
along the ravine, calling for volunteers to go
on a water detail.</p>

<p>From one of the holes King Cole’s voice
croaked: “I’ll go, lieutenant. I’ll go.” He
sounded like a bullfrog.</p>

<p>“I’ll go, too; be glad to,” Hicks offered.</p>

<p>“God, me too,” complemented Pugh.</p>

<p>“I only want two men. Pugh, you stay here.
All right, Hicks and Cole, collect up the canteens
and then I’ll tell you where to go.”</p>

<p>“Je’s, these canteens make a lot of noise.
The Squareheads can hear us for a mile. Hadn’t
we better put something around them?” Hicks
asked Lieutenant Bedford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, have the men unhook their canteen
covers and put them on. Now be careful when
you go, for the German lines are only a few hundred
yards. You follow this ravine until you
come to a place where it splits. Take the one
to the right. It leads into a little town where
there’s a pump.”</p>

<p>They started off, feeling their way over the
huge boulders that lay in the ravine. When
they were no more than a hundred yards from
the platoon, a shell severed the air over their
heads and burst in the field to their right.
They fell flat on their faces. After the shell
had exploded they got up and started again.
Another shell burst ten yards in front of them.
They ran forward again, the canteens jangling
over their shoulders. This time the shell burst
just to their left, throwing up a mass of dirt
which showered down on them.</p>

<p>“Good-by, canteens; I’m goin’ to throw mine
away and run,” said Cole.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are. And we die of thirst. Come
on, it’s not far now.”</p>

<p>They hurried blindly on. Another shell
screeched over their heads and struck the edge
of the ravine to their right. They were violently
thrown against the opposite side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sure do admire that boy’s aim. Let’s go,
Hicks.”</p>

<p>Abruptly the ravine shallowed out and they
found themselves running for the village, their
bodies wholly exposed. As they approached, a
door in one of the buildings of the badly battered
town was thrown open and a voice called:
“Here you are, fellows. Come in this way.”</p>

<p class="tb">“Hell, if you think you had it hard, you
ought to have been with us.”</p>

<p>Hicks and Cole, resting after they had filled
the canteens with water from a creaky pump
in the village square, were seated in a room of
the building through which they had entered
the town. At the window near the door a thin-snouted
Hotchkiss machine-gun was pointed out
over the field. Beside it, his head lying against
the saddle, a man was reclining. It was he who
had spoken.</p>

<p>“Think of carrying one of these guns over
your shoulder and walking through heavy rifle
fire the whole length of that field! Pretty
tough. Pretty tough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget about it; it’d a been worse if
you’d a been killed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know so much about that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“And when we got in this town. Boy, we
sure did clump them Dutchmen over the head!
Firin’ out of the windows, they were, and us
comin’ in in plain sight. But we knocked ’em
for a gool, a cock-eyed gool. I thought them
God-damned Squareheads could fight.” He
chuckled and stretched his body. “But you
oughta seen ’em run when we swarmed in here.”</p>

<p>“I guess they fought well enough to knock
off most of us.”</p>

<p>Hicks shuffled his feet restlessly. “Guess
we’d better be gettin’ back, King.”</p>

<p>It had grown quite dark and along the lines
of restless men white rockets were fired, to flare
for a moment, covering a part of the ground
with an intense brightness and then expiring on
the ground with a short hiss.</p>

<p>The platoon was not in sight when they returned
to the mouth of the ravine. But as the
clanking of their canteens was heard, men hurried
from their burrows and surrounded Hicks
and Cole.</p>

<p>“Here, give me mine.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s the one with the dent in the side,
Cole.”</p>

<p>“That’s not my canteen. Here, let me find
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Git the hell away from here or you’ll never
git anything to drink. Who the devil went
after this water, anyway?”</p>

<p>Sergeant Harriman stood in the background,
much to the surprise of Hicks, who had expected
him to rush forward demanding that he
be given his canteen first of all. The canteens
were passed out and Harriman’s was the next
to the last one.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hicks,” said Harriman warmly.</p>

<p>“Go easy on that water now; we can’t go running
to that town every five minutes, you men,”
Sergeant Ryan called.</p>

<p>Along the ravine the water gurgled from the
canteens into the mouths of the men. Their
most pressing want satisfied, their thoughts
soon turned to the matter of food, which they
had been without for two days, save for the
cans of salmon which Hicks and Pugh had salvaged
from the dead men’s packs. After expressing
among themselves their desire for food
they raised their voices and began to lament:</p>

<p>“What makes the wildcats wild?”</p>

<p>“Because they’re hungry.”</p>

<p>“Why are they hungry?”</p>

<p>“Because there ain’t no chow.”</p>

<p>“Why ain’t they got no chow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because they ain’t got nobody to look out
for them.”</p>

<p>“Pipe down, up there,” scolded Lieutenant
Bedford. “If the ration detail don’t come
along pretty soon, we’ll send one of our own
after chow.”</p>

<p>Hours of quiet passed, while the men silently
lay in their burrows in the ravine, listening to
the cheerful chirp of the crickets, and trying to
relax their nerves which had been tautened almost
to breaking by the terrific barrage of the
early afternoon.</p>

<p>“Je’s, I wish we had some more of that
salmon, Pugh. We were crazy to give it all
away.”</p>

<p>“No, we wasn’t. These mamma’s boys’d
starve to death if somebody didn’t pr’vide for
’em.”</p>

<p>While they were talking, Sergeant Harriman,
stealing along the ravine, came to their burrow:
“Here’s some Argentina beef that you fellows
can have some of. I got three cans of it.”</p>

<p>It was a little blue can, and when Pugh
lifted a piece of it to his mouth he shuddered.
“Smells like some’p’n you’ve stepped in. Mah
guts can’t go that stuff.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they can,” Harriman encouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“It’s not half bad if you don’t breathe while
you’re chewing it. I’ve been eating it all day.”</p>

<p>Pugh, holding his nostrils together, gulped
down a handful of the evil-smelling food.
“That’s not so bad, Hicksy. Try some of it.”</p>

<p>He passed over the can to Hicks.</p>

<p class="tb">In the early morning the German lines were
represented by a black strip of woods, some five
hundred yards in the distance, that looked a
narrow piece of jet-black lace through the gray
dawn. To the men on watch it was inconceivable
that such a calm, almost sketched scene
existed so near to them. The brain-piercing
explosions of the shells still remembered, the
calmness of the surroundings was unreal. Quiet
belonged to another world.</p>

<p>Day broke fully. From above, the hot sun
beat cruelly upon the earth. The helmets of
the men were like hot frying-pans. Sweat
soaked through the padding in the helmets and
ran down the men’s faces in tiny, dirty rivulets.
Their skin, beneath their woollen shirts and
breeches, itched unbearably. At the knees,
where the breeches tightly fitted, the shell powder
had soaked through and was biting the
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sameness about the expressions
on the men’s faces. As yet it was barely perceptible.
The mouths had set in certain rigid
lines. The lids of the eyes were narrowed, and
beneath them the pupils reflected only a dull
apathy. Of each man the shoulders sagged as
if bowed down with a dreadful weight.</p>

<p class="tb">Hicks lay against the sloping wall of the ravine,
his head peeping over, watching an airplane
circle lazily above. The drone of its engine
was like some enormous bluebottle fly. It
was soothing. A slight breeze rippled the
wheat. “Ah,” he breathed. But on the breeze
was carried a stomach-turning stench. It was
sweet and putrid and seemed to take substance
around the nostrils. As the heat of the day
grew more, the odor strengthened until Hicks
felt as if he were submerged in it up to his eyes.</p>

<p>As the sun glided out of sight the odor became
less evident, until at last, as the shadows
were thrown full length, it ceased entirely to be.</p>

<p class="tb">Lieutenant Bedford made his way along the
ravine. “Where’s Sergeant Harriman?”</p>

<p>Harriman poked his pallid face out of his
burrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are, Harriman. Pick out
four men to go after rations. Right after dark.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go along in charge?”</p>

<p>“Go if you want to. Ryan and I can take
care of things all right.”</p>

<p>The ration party tracked through the thick
woods, purpled with late evening. Trees
stretched gaunt arms in awkward gestures
toward the sombre-colored sky, through which
lights gaily winked and danced. Under foot
were objects over which they tried to step without
touching. Now and then a foot would
strike a dead man’s pack or his body, and some
one would draw back, mutter “Damn,” feeling
as if he had committed sacrilege. Branches of
trees, half torn from the trunk by shell explosion,
barred their way. On they walked,
their hands flung out in front of them, and walking
as closely to each other as was possible.
Passing one place in the woods Harriman
thought:</p>

<p>“Here’s where Halvorsen got killed.”</p>

<p>They went on farther. An open space in the
woods reminded him that it was there that Kahl
received three machine-gun bullets through his
head. “He’s probably rotten by this time.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Harriman shivered to his marrow. It seemed
hours before they got out of the woods and into
the field through which a small dusty road ran
toward the village where they had first gone
into action.</p>

<p>In outline the buildings, worn down by heavy
shell fire, clung to each other for moral encouragement.
They looked so tightly clustered in
their common misery suffered by devastation.</p>

<p>A shell, like the flash of lightning, hurtled
over and resounded as does that kind of lightning
after which one says: “That struck somewhere,
all right.”</p>

<p>The village was being used as the supply station
for the regiment. Inside the shattered
houses and barns the field kitchens had been
drawn; in the dim light made by candles the
mess sergeant was the centre of a group of unwashed
louts dressed in greasy blue denim.</p>

<p>“Say, Weaver, where’s our chow?”</p>

<p>“Been sellin’ another quarter of beef to the
Frogs again?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you let us catch you at any o’ them
fancy tricks.”</p>

<p>Weaver was a small, shifty-looking person.
It had been found out by the platoon that he
had once sold the company axe to a Frenchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
for a gallon of vin rouge, and since that time
he had always been suspected of making away
with the company’s rations.</p>

<p>“How do you boys expect to git any chow if
you don’t come after it? The chow was here,
but you wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“You think we can fight Germans and run
up here after chow, too?” The men were belligerent.</p>

<p>“Of course he does. These damned yellah
grease balls ain’t got any sense.”</p>

<p>“Yellow? I like that. Jist because you
guys are up there at the front that ain’t no sign
there ain’t other places jist as dangerous.”</p>

<p>The squabble would have gone on indefinitely
had not the arrival of a flock of shells ended it
then.</p>

<p>Weaver had thrown himself under the field
kitchen, where he arrived at the same time his
assistants did.</p>

<p>The ration party had remained standing.
“Get up, Weaver,” Harriman commanded,
“and get our chow.”</p>

<p>There was coffee, boiled potatoes, boiled beef
and white bread. Placing a stick through the
handles of the coffee container, Harriman and
another man led the way. One man carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the bread and the other two brought the potatoes
and meat.</p>

<p>They walked along the road to the woods
without an adventure. Through the woods
they made their way without a mishap until
they arrived at a clearing. Then, for some reason,
a salvo of shells were fired which struck
with the wild shriek of some lost soul. After
the shell had exploded, the man with the bread
could be seen gathering up the loaves from
where they had rolled when he threw himself
on the ground. The others had remained
standing for fear they would spill the food.</p>

<p class="tb">“Oh, Hicks. Hicksy, the ration party’s come.”</p>

<p>Pugh shook Hicks from his slumber.</p>

<p>“What.... The ration party? Whatta
they got?”</p>

<p>“That’s jis’ what I’m goin’ to see. Hurry up
or the rest of these hogs’ll eat it all up on us.”</p>

<p>They walked quickly toward the place where
a queue of men had formed.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, you guys. Bring your canteen
cups. Sergeant-major coffee.”</p>

<p>It was a glorious moment.</p>

<p>“Is it hot?” asked Hicks.</p>

<p>“Hot as blazes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold me, Pugh, I’m faintin’ with joy. Coffee,
hot! And milk and sugar in it.”</p>

<p>They sat around and munched their food and
drank their coffee. Under the feeling of warmth
in their stomachs many of the men relaxed and
their thoughts became once again normal.</p>

<p class="tb">The platoon had grown used to the late afternoon
bombardment that beat and slashed at
them every day. The shells driving at them
with a white fury were accepted as a part of
the whole stunning, disagreeable duty of the
front line. As their durance in the ravine
lengthened they were able even to comment
upon the fierceness or the comparative mildness
of the attack.</p>

<p>In his burrow Sergeant Ryan, his blouse and
undershirt lying by his side, was exploring with
his right hand a place beneath his left shoulder-blade
that had begun to pain. His fingers felt
a swollen, hurting lump. As he pressed on it,
a pain like being prodded in a nerve with a
needle shot through him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford, from a burrow near by,
leaned out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Ryan? Looking for
cooties?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, there’s something the matter with my
shoulder. It’s swelled.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see.... Hell, man, you’d better go
back to the dressing station. You’ve been hit.”</p>

<p>“Take your knife and see if you can get it
out.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I am, a surgeon? You
report to the first-aid station and let them send
you to the hospital. I don’t want any men
to come down with gangrene.”</p>

<p>Ryan, reluctant, departed alone, his small
reddish mustache still smartly waxed, his puttees
neatly rolled, his helmet set jauntily on his
head.</p>

<p class="tb">In the early morning light the outlines of the
objects in front of the ravine were crisply apparent.
The strands of barbed wire were
blackly filigreed against the opaque light of the
horizon. An aluminum moon hung waveringly
in the sky. The stalks of wheat stood stiffly
erect, their yellowness merging in the distance
with the shadowy green of the trees. On the
breath of the morning wind was carried the
sweet, sickening smell of decayed cadavers. To
the left and to the right unbroken lines of infinite
length lay huddled in holes, the guardians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of their snoring hours seeing without variation
the same sight. For the sector which the platoon
was holding the night had not been quiet.
Eyes, though worn with constant straining to
pierce the shadows, had seen the wheat tops
moving; and ears, the drums battered by the
explosion of striking shells, had still heard the
rustling among the stalks. So rifles, venomous
and catlike, had spit shots of fire into the dark.</p>

<p>As the sun rose, the heat growing more intense,
the nauseating smell from the corpses in
the field seemed to coat all objects in one’s line
of vision with a sticky green. Even the tops
of wheat, standing stiffly in the field, looked as
if they were covered with a fetid substance.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as the day advanced, a man
would labor over the opening of a can of Argentina
beef with the point of his bayonet. And
then the contents would be exposed, green and
sepulchrally white, the odor mingling and not
quite immersed in the odor of decaying human
flesh.</p>

<p>Laboring over the small blue can, sweat
poured down their chests, the streams dislodging
particles of dirt and sweeping them down
their bodies.</p>

<p>The air was dead. The sky was suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
not high above the earth. The odors had
ceased to move; they were massive, grotesquely
shaped objects fastly rooted to the earth. The
silence was elephantine.</p>

<p>And somewhere in the everlasting silence a
frightened, hurt, bewildered voice broke tentatively
forth:</p>

<p>“Landsmann. Oh, Landsmann! Kamerad.
Hilfen Sie mich.”</p>

<p>Hicks and Pugh, their heads peering over the
crest of the ravine, started, then listened, their
ears like terriers’.</p>

<p>“Mein Gott. Ich bin gewundet. O-o-o
G-o-tt.” The voice floated through the heavy
stillness.</p>

<p>Pugh put the butt of his rifle to his shoulder.
“Watch out; it’s one of their damned tricks.”</p>

<p>“Put down your gun, you fool. Nobody
could fake a voice like that.”</p>

<p>While they were talking the voice once again
reached them. In the stillness it seemed as if
it were at their sides. “Landsmann, Landsmann,
hilf mich bitte.”</p>

<p>“The poor fellow must be half dead. Kruger!
Oh, Paul, there’s a wounded Squarehead out in
front here. Talk to him, will you?”</p>

<p>A bleached but eager-faced Kruger came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of his burrow and commenced to talk in German
to the wounded man.</p>

<p>“What does he say, Paul? What does he
say?” A group had gathered around the scene.</p>

<p>“He says some of you guys shot him in the
guts and that he’s pretty bad off.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go out and git him. We can’t
let him lie there all day.”</p>

<p>“Is he all right, Kruger? I mean is he a
good guy?”</p>

<p>“How the hell do I know? He sounds all
right.”</p>

<p>“Kruger.” Pugh insinuated himself closer.
“Kruger, let’s you and me go git him? Huh?”</p>

<p>And Jack Pugh, from Meridian, Mississippi,
Jack Pugh, the gambler, who could make a
pair of ivory cubes cakewalk and tango, was the
first man to volunteer to rescue the wounded
German.</p>

<p>The German had to be moved very carefully.
Directly above the wide leather belt that he
wore around the waist the gray uniform was
soaked with blood. Pugh and Kruger carried
him from the field and lowered him to the bottom
of the ravine.</p>

<p>“Now what do you think of the Kaiser, you
damn Squarehead?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bet, by God, he wishes he’d stayed home
drinkin’ beer.”</p>

<p>“Hell, these Dutchmen git beer right in the
trenches.” The speaker passed his tongue over
his dry lips.</p>

<p>“Shut up. Can’t you let the poor devil
alone? He probably hates the Kaiser as much
as the rest of us.”</p>

<p>The wounded German raised himself on his
shoulder, gasping with pain. “Kaiser. Gottverdammt.”</p>

<p>He fell back exhausted.</p>

<p>The stretcher bearers who had been sent for
arrived and placed him on a stretcher. They
started to carry him to the dressing station.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute there, buddy.” A muddy,
wizened-face soldier, advancing with an open
razor in his hand, snipped a button from the
German’s tunic. “There, that goes home to
my gal.”</p>

<p class="tb">The platoon had been subjected to heavy
bombardment since, two weeks earlier, they had
occupied the ravine, but upon this particular
afternoon there was a force, a spitefulness, an
overwhelming, dull, sickening insistence to the
dropping, exploding shells that made each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of the men feel that, as any of them would have
expressed it, “one of them seabags has got my
name marked on it in big letters.” The shells
hammered over, shaking the sides of the ravine
as they broke and sending particles of flying
steel through the air, to land with a “zip” on
the ground. Men called for stretcher bearers
until there were no more stretcher bearers, and,
as it seemed, as if there were no more men to
call. And meanwhile the thick, pungent smoke
from the exploding shells was filling up the ravine
and seeking out the throats and eyes of
the men, to blind and choke them. Before it
was over there were men, ostrich-like, with their
heads in their burrows as far as they could get
them. Many of them were blubbering, not so
much from fright as from nerves that had
broken under the insistent battering of the
shells. But when it ended they were ready at
the call to stand by to repel an enemy of any
size.</p>

<p>It was felt certain that this time there would
be an attack by the Germans to regain the
woods from which they had been driven. The
men were working the bolts of their rifles, or
trying to check the tears that flowed from their
eyes, inflamed by the heavy smoke. But while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they were making ready to stand off the attack
the company commander sent a runner to Lieutenant
Bedford, telling him that the platoon
would be relieved for the night by other men,
and that they were to return farther back in
the woods and rest in case there was no attack.</p>

<p>Gasping and choking, the platoon made its
way out of the ravine and up the hill. Exhausted,
they dropped into the holes, slightly
deeper than their own, that the relieving men
had occupied. The captain, with his orderly
and his runners in holes around him, was lying
back on the ground, peacefully smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>But the attack which the officers had anticipated
failed to be made. The sun withdrew
from the scene and a pale gold moon took its
place, stars peeped out like eyes, and the air
became thin and chilly. The men were beginning
to feel that they were to enjoy a night’s
sleep.</p>

<p>Far off a faint whining began. Nearer and
nearer it came, growing louder and awe-inspiring.
It was as if some high priest of the elements
were working himself into a frenzy before
hurling an incantation at his supplicants.
It grew to a snarl, a bitter snarl full of hate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and it seemed as if the high priest had bared
his teeth, which were long, narrow, and sharply
pointed. The tree limbs bowed in fright, and
against the dull-blue sky the leaves turned under,
curling themselves up. Like a hurricane
the shells descended, and with terrific noise they
threw out splashes of reds and yellows, in the
light of which the trees seemed to cringe.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it,” thought Hicks, trying to
co-ordinate his jangling nerves. He sought
more closely to press his body against the clayey
side of his burrow. Sharply and frighteningly
another salvo of shells struck and burst in the
little patch of woods. Hicks bit at the leather
strap of his helmet. The tree limbs crackled
and falling branches fell hesitatingly through
the foliage to the ground. Other shells burst.
“Oh, my God, I’m hit!” some one cried. And
before he had ended his words another group of
shells pounded over. Hicks’s spine felt bare
with scorpions parading along the flesh. “I
won’t get killed. I can’t get killed. I’ve got
too much to live for,” he thought, as the bursting
shells continued and pieces of their steel
casing ripped past and viciously over him.
“Oh, God, don’t let me die.” The shells
mocked him. “Shall I pray? What shall I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
say? Oh, it wouldn’t do any good!” But he
formulated an incoherent prayer between interruptions
of his fancying that among the trees
was a huge black animal with fiery eyes and
hoofs of brimstone that were kicking and prancing
all over the woods. The animal’s head was
above the trees, and it snapped at their limbs
with its long, punishing jaws. Hicks felt as if
his eyes would pop from his head and that his
temples would split. The animal’s hoofs kicked
nearer him, and he closed his eyes and twisted
his neck in fear. Red, purple, white lights
danced before his eyes. He turned round to
face the monster, forcing a grin over his stiff
face. Then he began to cry and then ...
blackness, all was blackness.</p>

<p>The morning sun sent wavering rays through
the boughs of the trees, and exposed the white
stumps whose tops had been blown to the earth
by exploding shells. Tree limbs, with ghastly
butts, lay dead-still on the thick, calm grass.
Steel helmets, spattered with blood, were now
and then encountered on the ground. On the
space where the captain had been lying there
was a blood-soaked shoe and a helmet, turned
bottom up, and neatly holding a mess of brains.
Near by lay a gas-mask which would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
again be used. And near it the sleeve of a
coat.</p>

<p>Hicks awakened and cautiously sat up, his
head peeping over the top of his burrow. Close
enough to be touched a body, the legs spread
wide, the chin raised high, and the chest slightly
puffed, offered its belly to the sun. Hicks stiffly
got out and looked at the body. “By God, they
did come close all right,” he breathed.</p>

<p>Hicks walked over to the helmet. Like an
inexperienced surgeon prodding a wound, he
touched at the helmet, finally discovering on
the leather cover of the padding the initials
“W. O. P.” As he straightened he felt a deep
pity, a great sorrow. “I used to cuss him a
lot and he was an awful bonehead, but he was
a pretty good fellow.”</p>

<p>Weighted down by two large food containers,
four men made their way, stumbling and cursing,
into the patch of woods. Seeing no one
but Hicks, one angrily called: “Hey, you guys,
don’t you want no chow?”</p>

<p>Out of nowhere a group of perhaps twenty-five
men gathered around the pails of food.</p>

<p>“All right, you guys, snap it up. We can’t
wait here all day. Quit fingerin’ your noses
and grab your mess kits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Another man, resting from carrying the heavy
stuff, started forth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, the infantry and the cavalry</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And the dirty engineers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They couldn’t lick the leathernecks</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In a hundred thousand years.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pugh looked at him sourly. “You all
wouldn’t be singin’ that if you’d been wi’ us
las’ night. You musta been hidin’ in some
dugout eatin’ up our rations.”</p>

<p>“Who?” The man broke off, indignant.</p>

<p>“Who? Who?” said Pugh. “Your feet
don’t fit no limb.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?”—incensed.</p>

<p>“Oh, gwahn.”</p>

<p>With their canteen cups the men dipped
eagerly into the thick, brown, greasy fluid.</p>

<p>“God, an’ it’s hot, too.”</p>

<p>But for the most part they were silent. One
man tasted of the concoction in the other receptacle.
He began to retch horribly.</p>

<p>Usually, the early afternoon was the period
of the day’s recreation for the men in the ravine,
an hour more favorable to their personal pursuits.
Between the time when an attack might
be expected and the diurnal four-o’clock German
bombardment, the moment gave the platoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a chance once more to assume their normal
existence. At such a time the guardians of the
ravine would emerge from their burrows and,
under the shade of an overhanging tree, try to
recollect their thoughts.</p>

<p>It was now such a time, and Sergeant Harriman
was sitting cross-legged in the ravine,
assaulting with the point of his bayonet a can
of Argentina beef. Events of late had left him
shaken. He had entered the trenches with a
handicap; he believed that he was a crusader
reincarnate, engaged in the holy service of saving
religion, morality, purity, and civilization
from the barbaric hand of that nation whose
people he referred to as Huns. He had enlisted
because he was of draft age and would be unqualified
to dodge the call of Congress, requesting
him to join the selected army of the United
States of America. Had he possessed a widowed
mother, or a wife and child, he would as
gladly have fought the Hun from an office desk
in Kenosha.</p>

<p>He had pierced the cover of the foul beef
when a messenger from battalion headquarters
parted the trees near Harriman and dropped in
the ravine. Seeing Harriman, he spoke:</p>

<p>“Is this the Third Platoon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is, you know.” Harriman had picked up
the postscript to his sentence from a man of
many enlistments and whom he tried in many
ways to emulate.</p>

<p>“You one of the non-coms?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Harriman answered pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Well.” The messenger reached in the
leather saddle-bag suspended from his shoulders.
“Got some mail for the Third Platoon. You
take it?”</p>

<p>“Bet I will.” Harriman fairly grabbed at
the package of letters, so eager he was to see if
it contained one for him. Yes, there it was.
The one he had expected, waited for these many
days.</p>

<p>“Gillespie!” he called. “Gillespie, do you
want to give out the mail?”</p>

<p>Gillespie hurried forward, got the package,
and ran to the middle of the ravine, calling:
“Mailo, mailo, Third Platoon.”</p>

<p>The envelope which Harriman fondly and
carefully opened was different from the other
letters in the package. On it the stamp had
been glued at an angle which, to many young
men and women, meant “I love you.” The
stationery was lavender and a reminiscent odor
of sachet was on it. The writing was cramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and affectedly schoolgirlish. Harriman unfolded
the sheet of lavender paper.</p>

<p>“Dear Carl,” it began. “You poor dear
boy!! How you must be suffering over there
in those horrid trenches. And how <em class="smcapuc">BRAVE</em> of
you to be so joking about it. But <em class="smcapuc">WE</em> know how
badly the conditions really are. The papers
keep reporting the <em class="smcapuc">FRIGHTFULNESS</em> of those
Huns, and I pray each night that you won’t be
taken prisoner and be treated as some of our
poor boys have been treated. The other day
Mrs. Wilwerscheid told mama the most <em class="smcapuc">AWFUL</em>
story of what the Huns were doing to our prisoner
boys. Oh, Carl, it was so awful that I
cannot repeat it. I ought not to even <em class="smcapuc">THINK</em>
of it. But we know that our Carl is too brave
to let <em class="smcapuc">HIMSELF</em> be taken prisoner.</p>

<p>“Four of your letters came to-day and it set
me wondering where you are. Are you, by any
chance, at Chateau Therry? They say there
are a great many of our American boys there.
I sent you a box two weeks ago. I wonder if
you got it. I put in a helmet that I had knitted
<em class="smcapuc">ESPECIALLY</em> for you, and six big bars of chocolate.
You must have <em class="smcapuc">PLENTY</em> of cigarettes.
Both Helene Mason and I have subscribed to
<em class="smcapuc">OODLES</em> of soldiers’ tobacco funds. You know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
you pay a quarter and get a box of cigarettes
and tobacco. You can write whosever name on
it that you want to and it will be sent to him.
So of course I made Helene write yours. I
know that you used to not smoke cigarettes,
but the papers say that now that all the boys
over there are smoking them and of course you
would be doing what the rest of the boys are.
Remember, I didn’t use to like to see boys
smoke. But I am willing to sacrifice a mere
prejudice for so great a cause as you boys are
fighting for. And then Rector Tyson, of the
First M. E., said from the pulpit the other
Sunday that he thought it was all right for the
boys over there to smoke. He is so broad-minded!</p>

<p>“Carl dear, this war will never end. You
have been over there so long. Almost a year,
and mama keeps talking about John Ryder (he
has a big farm now and is raising the food that
the government most needs), and saying that
Carl will never come back. Would you forgive
me if I did, Carl? I mean, became Mrs. John
R. Ryder? You better hurry or I will.</p>

<p class="center">Your loving</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S. The papers say that we must call you
Sammies now. Are you my little Sammy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Hope was burned to a white crisp in his intense
disappointment. It left him feeling cold
and as if a large hole had been burned in his
side. His eyes were blinded and weak as if by
a sudden glare. “Oh, damn. Oh, damn.” He
crushed the letter in the palm of his hand,
making it a paper wad. Feverishly he unfolded
the letter, spreading out the wrinkles. Ellen
danced before him, a fiend with golden hair, an
angel who had a forked tongue. She didn’t
care, she never cared. But she did, a voice informed
him, rationalizing his experiences with
her, the words she had spoken to him. She
must still care. There was hope. If only he
could get back, could see her, could talk to her....
But that was ridiculous. He would stay
there with the platoon until he was killed, or,
by a piece of luck, wounded. He looked at the
combat-packs whose owners never would wear
them again, at the pierced helmets and the
blood-stained gas-masks. Pieces of equipment
were scattered over the ground alongside the
small, pitiful holes which had been dug for
safety. The tall, straight trees grew thicker in
the distance. Their shadows invited him. The
grass acted as a continual spring-board, pushing
his body forward into the thicket. On he
walked, a smile, half of gladness, half of bewilderment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
turning up the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>At last, out of sight of every one, in the
thickest of the woods, he sat upon a small hill
and regarded his misshapen, hobnailed shoe.
It held a curious fascination for him. Yes, the
little bump was where the small toe curled.
But none of his other toes reached to the end
of the shoe, he reflected. What nice leather.
A shame to spoil such leather as that. Yes, a
shame, and besides.... From his pack he
drew a small, round can of Argentina beef,
which he balanced between his instep and the
toe of his shoe. No harm in spoiling that!
He wiggled his toes around in the shoe and felt
squeamish. His hand felt for his pistol at his
side. Yes, there it was and nicely oiled. He
drew the pistol from the holster and aimed it at
the small blue can. Forty-five-caliber pistols
kicked up in the air when they were fired, he
remembered. He aimed it a bit lower—and
<em>bang</em>. For a moment he felt nothing. The
grin was still on his face. Then his look
changed to one of consternation. Better go
back and report to the platoon. He rose to his
feet, took a few steps, and fell to the ground.
By heavens, this was no joke, shooting yourself
in the foot. This was serious business. Hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and everything. Then he remembered that
he had done it himself. It was probably the
first time that he had really known it. Court
martial and disgrace. And he had only meant
to get back home. He began to whimper.</p>

<p class="tb">Lieutenant Bedford, his skin the color of sun-bleached
ash, walked among the men, a beaten
Napoleon. A patch of black, ragged beard, his
heavy, bristling mustache, his dull brown eyes
that seemed to pain, made him appear more
dead than alive as he loped along. The men
remained lying on the ground, recognizing his
approach by a speculative glance. Their faces
were interestingly similar. A dull gray pallor
overspread them all. Their eyes were leaden,
expressionless, save for a kind of apathetic fear
of the inevitable. Each lower jaw hung at the
same depressed angle. Lieutenant Bedford sat
down as if it were his final act.</p>

<p>“Any of you men feel like doing any work?”
There was no answer. Lieutenant Bedford
spoke again. “I got to have a work detail.
These fellows must be buried. Are there any
volunteers?” After a short silence some one
asked weakly: “Where is that damned grave-digger
battalion? What are they for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, where are they? I didn’t come in
this man’s army to dig graves.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford tried to appear indignant.
“How the hell do you expect the grave-diggers
to be here when the artillery haven’t even got
up here yet? Nope, we’ve got to bury them,
that’s all. Besides, they’re our dead. They’ll
be stinkin’ like hell by to-night if we don’t bury
’em,” he encouraged. “Harriman,” he went on
in a sort of drone, “pick out a burial detail and
have the men work in reliefs.” There was no
“yes, sir” forthcoming. The men looked at
each other and then at Lieutenant Bedford.
“Harriman ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“Did he get knocked off, too?” Lieutenant
Bedford asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, he was around here this morning.”</p>

<p>“Does anybody know what happened to him?
Where’d he go?”</p>

<p>No one knew.</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s gone, he’s gone.” Lieutenant
Bedford grew decisive. “Lepere, you take
charge. You don’t need to bury ’em so deep.
They’ll have to be dug up again, anyway.”</p>

<p>Lepere showed surprising signs of life. “All
right, men.” His accents became almost crisp.
“Hicks, Pugh, Bullis, Hartman, Kruger.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pointed his finger impressively as he named off
eight men.</p>

<p>Sullen, they rose and stood around hesitatingly,
asking: “Where are the shovels? Do
you expect us to dig holes with our hands?”
Bullis was weak and exasperated.</p>

<p>Lepere had become a dynamo. He radiated
energy. “You’ll find plenty of shovels right
down by where Captain Powers was killed.
Follow me.” The men trailed off in a group.</p>

<p>They set to work laboriously. Soon the first
hole had reached a depth so that the bodies
would not be too near the surface when the
dirt was thrown back in place. On a bloody
stretcher a mutilated body was carried to the
freshly dug hole and rolled over upon a blanket.</p>

<p>“All right there, Pugh. Grab hold.” Lepere
was peremptory.</p>

<p>“Lepeah, Ah can’t. I’d throw up my guts.
You call me when you’re ready to dig the next
hole.” Pugh walked away.</p>

<p>“Come back here, Pugh. I’ll report you for
insubordination.”</p>

<p>“Ah doan cah wot yo do. Go to hell.”</p>

<p>While Lepere had been talking the body had
been lifted into the hole and the first shovelful
of dirt had been thrown over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, wait a minute. Stop that. We’ve got
to git his dog-tag off.”</p>

<p>Lepere stooped over the body and fumbled
at the dirty collar. “Gimme a knife.” He
snipped one of the identification disks from the
greasy string. Stuffing it in his pocket, he drew
back and ordered: “Now go ahead.”</p>

<p>The business was continued silently. Bodies
were carried to the clearing marked off for the
temporary burial-place, rolled in a blanket, and
dropped into shallow holes. Before they were
dumped into their temporary graves their pockets
were searched and the contents placed in
little piles on the ground. Some of the bodies
were unrecognizable, although the men at work
had seen them and talked with them the day
before. One or two of the bodies looked as if
life had fled them peacefully. The uniforms
were unspotted with blood, the faces were calm.
But some of the faces were distorted. The lips
rose from the teeth and made them look like
fangs. One body, on which the skin looked like
liver, had been struck lifeless a few days earlier.
It stunk terrifically, and when Lepere’s hands
sought out the neck for the identification tag,
his fingers sank into the flesh. But he went
stolidly on about his work. Hicks turned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
body and engaged in a paroxysm of gagging.
He turned again, his face the color of a piece of
paper. The work went on.</p>

<p>The late afternoon sun shone upon a group of
mounds of fresh-dug dirt. Each mound was
marked by two rough sticks, made to form a
cross, at the juncture of which a small aluminum
disk bearing a number was fastened. A few
yards away men were eating cold beef, cold
boiled potatoes, and drinking lukewarm coffee
from their muddy canteen cups.</p>

<p class="tb">The sky was clear and the air was like a bell.
It could have been fancied that any noise must
be a tinkling one. The tree tops were tall
Gothic spires that reached to the heavens. The
man in the moon was distinct in the round, pale
ball that threw silvery sheets into the forest.</p>

<p>The platoon believed that it had embarked
upon a night that at last was to be silent, harmless.
They tried to stretch their muscles, which
had been taut for days; their thoughts sought
out other and more pleasant scenes of remembrance.
The air was crisp and their bodies felt
comfortable under their blankets. Their heads,
pillowed on their gas-masks, were, for once, inert.
Fear had flown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The first shell that whined its course from the
German lines to the place where they were
asleep passed unnoticed. It struck the ground
with a “P-tt.” The next one did likewise, but
some one awakened. He touched the man lying
near to him. “What was that?” he asked fearfully,
wanting to be assured. Another shell,
sounding like a full bottle that is shaken,
dropped several yards away.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell,” said the aroused man. “The
Squareheads are out of ammunition. They’re
shootin’ beer-bottles over.” He fell asleep, unconcerned.
The first man sniffed. “Beer-bottles!
I guess not. GAS!” he screamed, in a
panic. Grunting, swearing, frightened, the men
got their masks over their faces in less time than
they had been trained to. Now they sat
around tense, their minds blank, the saliva running
down their chins from the mouthpiece of
the mask.</p>

<p>Ahead of them, in the ravine, where they had
been a few days ago, shells broke, reporting
noisily. More shells were hurled over, to fall
and explode, battering at the ravine. Meanwhile
the barely discernible P-tt continued
around them. The bombardment seemed to be
everlasting. Under so heavy a bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the ravine must be levelled out. Bang, crash,
bang, up in front at the ravine. P-tt, P-tt, P-tt,
back where the platoon was lying. Out of the
noise a voice was heard calling: “Hey, Third
Platoon. We want volunteers for stretcher
bearers!” Through the dimness made by the
glass eyes of his mask, Hicks saw a man come
stumbling through the trees.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Third Platoon?” the form
cried.</p>

<p>Hicks drew off his mask, yelled “HERE!”
and replaced it, then forcing the contaminated
air out of the mask.</p>

<p>“We want volunteers.” The form had a
querulous voice.</p>

<p>Hicks took off his mask again. “Put on your
mask!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Damn the mask!” cursed the form. “We’ve
got nothing but wounded men up at the front
line and we want some help.”</p>

<p>From somewhere among the still figures
Lieutenant Bedford arose and walked to the
form.</p>

<p>“Hello, doc. You better put on your mask.
The gas is damn heavy here.” He dove into
his mask again.</p>

<p>“Damn it, I came back here for volunteers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
not to be told what to do. We got a lot of
wounded men up there.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll get you some men.” He summoned
six men and ordered them to take litters
up to the ravine.</p>

<p class="tb">“Good God, Hicks, don’t go so fast. Wait a
minute.”</p>

<p>“All right; let your end down, then.”</p>

<p>Hicks and Pietrzak had been assigned to the
job of litter bearers. It was now the third time
that they had carried a wounded man from the
ravine to the first-aid station, almost two miles
away. To do so they had to escape the shells
that fell so numerously in the ravine, and, with
their masks on, to carry their burden through
the gulley filled with gas. On arriving at the
first-aid station the first time they found their
burden to be dead. His arm had been severed
from his body. The second man was unconscious
when he was lowered to the ground
in front of the first-aid station. Now they
were on the way from the ravine once more,
carrying a man whose middle had been pierced
by a fragment of shell casing. As they lowered
the stretcher to rest, the man groaned
and pleaded with them to go on. Hicks tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to reason: “We’ll never git there if we don’t
take a little rest. We’ll be there soon, buddy.
Do you want a drink?” He offered his canteen.
“No, just take me away from here,” the man
groaned piteously. They rested until they
could endure the man’s groaning no longer; then
they started off. They had no more than
started when a shell struck directly in rear of
them. They plodded on with their burden,
stumbling over the boulders in the gulley. A
little farther on and another shell exploded.
On they went until the mustard-like odor of
gas filled their nostrils. Then they stopped to
put on their masks. Letting his end of the
stretcher sink slowly to the ground, Hicks
asked the wounded man: “Can you wear a
mask, buddy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes, give it to me. I’ll die without
it.” Fear in the man’s voice was stronger than
pain. Hicks bent over the man’s chest for the
familiar respirator. It was gone. “Where is
your mask?” he asked. “I don’t know.” Very
gently Hicks raised his head and placed his
mask over the face of the wounded man. They
started on again. Rapidly, successively, three
shells struck close by. The rear end of the
stretcher dropped to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pete!” cried Hicks.</p>

<p>Pietrzak did not answer, and Hicks, putting
down his end of the stretcher, walked to the
other end and felt along the ground. Pietrzak
was lying on his side. His neck was wet with
blood. A large piece of shell casing had struck
him below the ear, and he was now quite dead.
His mask was in shreds.</p>

<p>The wounded man was unconscious. Until
he was hoarse and the gas had burned his
eyes so that they were coals of fire, Hicks
called for help. But none came. His eyes
smarting dreadfully, Hicks wrapped his coat
around his head and took up his night’s vigil
beside the wounded man. The bombardment
continued most of the night.</p>

<p>When the sun made its pilgrimage over the
rim of the distant field and showered the scene
with light, Hicks was still sitting on a small rock
beside the stretcher, his chin supported by his
knees, the coat over his head.</p>

<p class="tb">For a distance of two miles, from the ravine
to the village where the supply wagons were
stationed, men lay dead and dying. In the
woods and particularly in the gulley that ran
through the woods to the village, the thick yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
gas clung to the ground. Wherever the gas
had touched the skin of the men dark, flaming
blisters appeared. Like acid, the yellow gas
ate into the flesh and blinded the eyes. The
ground was a dump-heap of bodies, limbs of
trees, legs and arms independent of bodies, and
pieces of equipment. Here was a combat pack
forlorn, its bulge indicating such articles as a
razor, an extra shirt, the last letter from home,
a box of hard bread. Another place a heavy
shoe, with a wad of spiral puttee near by.
Where yesterday’s crosses had been erected, a
shell had churned a body out of its shallow
grave, separating from the torso the limbs. The
crosses themselves had been blown flat, as if by
a terrific wind.</p>

<p>In the gray light of early morning Hicks felt
the fury of impotence as he tried to rise. He
unwound the coat that covered his head, forgetful,
unmindful for the moment of the man
whom he had guarded during the night. He
seemed fastened to the surface of the stone.
Dimly he knew that his legs burned with an
awful pain. But the feeling of pain was lost in
his marvelling at his inability to rise. Not far,
distant voices sounded. Soon a detail of men
filed along the gulley, commenting among themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
upon the havoc of the night. He called
weekly to the men who were approaching. As
their hands touched him he lost his senses and
all went black.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p>It was the night for relief. Fourteen men,
with the remainder of their equipment about
them, huddled around in a group waiting for
the new troops to appear and take over their
sector. They were tired, hungry, and nerve-racked;
the word “morale” could not conceivably
be associated with them. Their three
weeks’ experience in the woods had so bludgeoned
their senses that they had been unresponsive
when told that they were to be relieved.
But after a while they partly recovered under
the stimulation of the picture of warm food and
a shelter of comparative safety. From a thick
apathy they became clamorous, ill at ease, waiting
for the new men to come. As the darkness
grew their nerves twitched, and they peered
often and again down the gulley from which the
relief was to come into sight. At last a muffled
clatter reached their ears. It swelled and was
accompanied by voices in a polyglot of tongues.
Cigarette lights and the flare of matches were
seen along the line of the incoming horde.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bedford had risen at their approach.
Now he nervously shifted his weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from one leg to the other. “The drafted
idiots,” he muttered, “do they want to kill all
of us with these lights? Hey, you guys,” he
called, “put out those damned matches.” A
swell of jeers greeted him.</p>

<p>“All right, Third Platoon, let’s go. If these
damned fools want every German gun to start
pounding at them, let them. Come on.”</p>

<p>The platoon rose wearily and dragged through
the woods in the direction of the village. Their
spirits were so depressed, their bodies so fatigued,
that, though the village was but two
miles distant, an hour had elapsed before they
marched through the cluttered streets between
the rows of battered houses. But they did not
stop. The outline of the village faded and on
they tramped. Behind them shells rumbled
over from the German lines, and, in answer, the
crack and the sudden flare of a large gun being
fired sounded to the right and left of them. At
the noise the men’s muscles tightened, their nostrils
narrowed and were bloodless. At the appearance
of danger unheralded they were thorough
automata; the explosions urged on their
tired legs, whose muscles seemed tied in inextricable
knots. Thick forests rose on each side of
the tortuous white road, their dark-blue tops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bewitchingly patterned against the sky. Where
the woods were divided by a narrow path the
platoon turned off, marching between the trees.</p>

<p>Farther in the woods, where the path widened
slightly, the men halted. In ten minutes they
were curled up in their blankets, asleep.</p>

<p>The platoon awoke in the heat of the day.
In the woods the leaves of the trees were unruffled
by a breeze. Glaring down from directly
above, the sun was a monstrous incinerator.
But for it all nature would have been
inanimate. The men stretched experimentally.
Their empty intestines made them aware of
themselves. From among the trees floated a
rich odor of frying food. “Steak,” some one
guessed. The smell intensified their hunger,
weakened them. King Cole, shading the sun
from his owl-like eyes, sat up and sniffed.</p>

<p>“Who said ‘steak’?” he observed. “Smells
like good old Kentucky fried chicken to me.”</p>

<p>“Chicken, hell,” said Hartman, the professional
pessimist. “It’s probably fried Canned
Bill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me sick,” Cole answered.
“Can’t you let a man dream?”</p>

<p>But it was steak. And dipped in flour before
it was fried. It was not choice steak, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
edible, very edible. And the quantity had been
prepared for sixty men, while there were only
fourteen men to dine.</p>

<p>“Go easy,” cautioned Lieutenant Bedford,
gnawing a huge steak which he held in his hand.
“There’s plenty of chow, so you don’t need to
be in a hurry to eat it all. You’ll do better if
you eat slowly. Stomach’s not used to this
sort of food.”</p>

<p>“Je’s, this is jist like bein’ home,” King Cole
informed the assembly.</p>

<p>“Home? You never had a home. What are
you talkin’ about?” jeered McCann, the New
York roughneck who had been confined in the
hospital twice with delirium tremens. “Ho
there, you yellow greaseball, what do you
want?” He hailed one of the mess helpers who
was approaching.</p>

<p>“I heard that R. E. McCann got scairt and
shot himself when he got up to the front, and I
come down to see if it was true.”</p>

<p>The greaseball, whose name describes him
well, looked inquiringly around. McCann failed
to answer the badinage. The greaseball sat
down among the men, who now had become
filled and grew confidential. “You fellahs had
a pretty tough time up there, didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll say we did.”</p>

<p>“You’d a thought so if you’d a been there,
you lowlife.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, pretty soft for you birds in the galley.”</p>

<p>“But not as soft as it’s goin’ to be for you
guys,” the greaseball was ingratiating.</p>

<p>“Whaddya mean?” the platoon scoffed.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you heard?” The greaseball looked
surprised.</p>

<p>“Heard nothin’,” Cole answered grumpily.
“Where’ve we been to hear anything?”</p>

<p>“Well,” hesitatingly, “maybe I hadn’t ought
to tell.”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell, greaseball.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, what the hell else are you good for?”</p>

<p>“Well ... you guys ain’t goin’ back to the
front no more.”</p>

<p>“<em>Hooray!</em>” they sceptically shouted. “You
damned liar.”</p>

<p>“Fact. The brigade commander was down
here yesterday, and I heard him tell Major
Adams that the First Battalion was goin’ on
board ship.”</p>

<p>“Oh-o. That ain’t so good. I was sick all
the way over on that damn transport,” Pugh
remembered aloud.</p>

<p>“Sure, you always do,” said Rousey, the old-timer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
“But after the first cruise you’re all
right. God, man, you don’t know how soft it
is on board ship. A clean bunk and good chow.
Shore leave whenever you go into port. Why,
I remember——”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right, but I’ll take my chances
with my feet on the ground. There ain’t no
damn whale gonna eat me, not if I know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a blame sight better than lettin’
them Squareheads use you for a target. I’m
glad we’re goin’.”</p>

<p>While they talked the rumor that they had
so sceptically regarded had become a fact. No
one doubted that they were soon to be loaded
into box cars and sent off to some seaport, where
trim, clean ships would be waiting to take them
aboard.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p>Snorting gray camions drew up along the
road by the path where the men were lying.
At the driving-wheels the small Japanese, with
their long, tired mustaches covered with fine
dust, looked like pieces of graveyard sculpture.
The dust was over their faces, over their light-blue
uniforms. They sat immovable. The men
took their seats upon the narrow benches and
the camions chugged away.</p>

<p>A river crawled along, its straight banks parallel
with the road over which the camions were
moving. In the crepuscular light it was a dark,
straggly, insignificant stream, which, compared
by the platoon with rivers that they had known,
was only a creek. It was quite dark when the
camions stopped at a town along the river,
built in the valley between large hills. The
men debarked and were assigned to their billets
wherever empty rooms could be found in the
houses.</p>

<p>In Nanteuil, the name of the village where
they had stopped, the ranks of the platoon were
filled by men from one of the replacement battalions
that recently had arrived in France from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the United States. A daily routine was quickly
established, and with but one day’s rest the
platoon was kept at work from early morning
until late afternoon. They drilled four hours a
day, were inspected daily by the acting company
commander, tried to rid themselves of lice by
swimming in the Marne, made secret expeditions
to neighboring villages, where they got
drunk and made amorous eyes at sloppy French
grandmothers, threw hand-grenades in the river
and watched the dead fish rise to the surface,
swore at the gendarmes when those persons remonstrated
with them, shrank into basements
whenever the long-distance German shells were
aimed at the bridge that crossed the river at
Nantueil, cursed their officers, and tried to scare
the new men by exaggerating the frightfulness
of the front, gorged themselves on the plentiful
rations, and played black jack, poker, or rolled
dice out of sight of their officers. The officers
smiled and told each other that they were not
only recovering their morale, but were imbuing
the new men with that spirit peculiar to the
Marine Corps.</p>

<p>The platoon had been in Nanteuil one week
when Hicks returned, dusty, tired, and hungry.
The older men crowded around him eagerly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
while the more recent members stood off wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Well, Hicksy, old boy, did you have a good
rest?” Pugh asked.</p>

<p>“Rest? Rest hell. The only way you can
get a rest is to get killed. But don’t go to the
hospital thinking you’ll get it.” Hicks paused,
sat down and lighted a cigarette. “Remember
that night they put over the gas attack?” He
was assured by each of the old-timers that he
did.</p>

<p>“Well, the next afternoon I woke up in an
evacuation hospital. They carried me in on a
stretcher, and when I opened my eyes there was
a lousy doctor standing over me. ‘What are
you doing here?’ he asked. Well, I could
hardly talk, but I managed to whisper that I
was gassed. He looked down at my card that
the first-aid officer had pinned on me. ‘God
damn it, get up, you coward,’ he said to me.
‘What the hell do you mean by taking a
wounded man’s place?’ Of course, I was sore
as hell, but what could I do? So I stuck around
a while until an ambulance started for our battalion,
and then I hid in it and came along.”</p>

<p>The men cursed the medical officer effusively.</p>

<p>“Saw Harriman back there,” Hicks continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
“He was lyin’ in bed with his foot in a
sling. Said he got lost and some Squarehead
shot him.” Hicks threw the butt of his cigarette.
“But if you think the medical officers
are bad, you ought to see the enlisted men.
Don’t take any souvenirs back with you if you
go. The damn orderlies’ll steal ’em. One guy
had a Luger pistol and about four hundred
francs when he got in the hospital, and they
give him a bath, and when he come out he
hadn’t a thing in his clothes. But I got a good
hot bath, I’ll say that much. And I got some
clean clothes. The damned clothes I had stunk
so of gas that they had to bury them.”</p>

<p>“How was the chow?”</p>

<p>“Rotten. And you have to line up in the
mud in your pajamas to get it if you’re a walking
patient. They say the base hospitals are
worse.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, but you don’t have no shavetail raggin’
you around all the time, do you?”</p>

<p>“The hell you don’t. Them damned orderlies
who are supposed to do the work hand you
a broom and tell you to clean up the deck, or
wash up the toilets, or make up somebody’s
bed.” Hicks got up and limped away. “Got
to report to the company commander.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“How come you’re limpin’, Hicksy?”</p>

<p>“Still got sores on my legs where that confounded
gas burned.”</p>

<p>The new men vowed that they never would
get shot.</p>

<p>After an hour’s close order drill the next day
Hicks was noticed to be unable to keep in step.
Three times Lieutenant Bedford bit his lip and
refrained only by great repression from reprimanding
him. When the platoon came to a
halt, Lieutenant Bedford moved over to Hicks
and quietly and venomously asked: “Hicks,
what the hell’s the matter with you? Why the
hell do you walk along like you had a brick in
your pants?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t help it, Lieutenant
Bedford. I still have sores on my legs.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you doing back here then?
Fall out and report to the sick-bay at once.”
Lieutenant Bedford was exasperated.</p>

<p>Hicks limped out of sight. But after that he
did not drill with the platoon. Each day when
they set out he watched them from the window
of the bare room where his squad was billeted.
And each day the sergeant of the Medical Corps
secretly treated him for his burns. At the close
of a week Hicks was well, and when orders were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
received for the platoon to move he was quite
ready.</p>

<p>Then began a dismal time; when, almost invariably,
the platoon had been marched into
some woods at night and had made their beds
on the ground, they would be ordered to make
up their equipment and be ready to march in
an hour or less. Thus they lived in the woods
in the daytime and at night marched from one
forest to another.</p>

<p>Not even the officers could give a reason for
the senseless manœuvring. It was during this
time that the rumor became common that they
were to board battleships and effect a landing
party on the Mole; they also were to be sent to
southern France to a rest camp as soon as their
barracks near Marseilles had been completed;
they also were to be returned to the United
States and be split up to serve as recruiting officers
and instructors to the drafted men. These
rumors, and the occasional rations of cigarettes
they were given, helped them to endure their
nightly pilgrimages and their cramped daily
lives in the woods.</p>

<p>And then one day, when they had despaired
ever of doing anything but moving through the
night from one clump of woods to another, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
order was received for the platoon to be ready
to entrain on camions at three that afternoon.
They did not know whether to rejoice or not.</p>

<p>The march was more weary than even they
had expected. They had left the camions early
that morning, and had begun a climb up a long,
punishing hill whose summit seemed in the
clouds. On this road the marching was even,
steady. There was no body of troops in front
of the platoon to cause it to halt, stand with
heavy packs cutting through the shoulder muscles,
and then march on again. A forest on one
side, the scene stretched out on the other a
long, flat prairie of glistening wheat. On and
on they marched, reaching the summit of the
hill and escaping the sun where large, tall trees
bowed in a canopy over the road. Noon came
and day disappeared; the shadows threw themselves
fantastically upon the road, and still the
platoon continued its steady tramp. The air
grew cool. It found an easy entrance through
the slight clothing of the men and covered their
bodies with a dampness. Darkness found them
heavily pounding out the miles along the road.
Men began grumbling, threatening to fall out
along the roadside. They were indignant at
not having rested, at not being fed. One man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
desiring to drink, reached for his canteen and
found it empty. His voice rose plaintively in
the stillness. Other men felt thirst. They
made known their desires in language reproachful
and uncomplimentary to their officers.</p>

<p>At midnight the platoon stopped. It turned
into the woods and lay down. Orders were
passed among the men to dig holes in the
ground for protection. “We’ll be here all
night,” the officers said, “and there may be
an attack before we shove off.”</p>

<p>The men greeted the order by failing to move.
Several of them muttered that they didn’t give
a damn whether the enemy attacked or not.
Suddenly, out of the thick blackness of the
woods and the night a six-inch gun barked and
recoiled, barked again and recoiled. The shells
sped through the night, striking, æons afterward,
with the noise of a pricked balloon. Another
salvo shot over into the darkness, the ignition
of the charge lighting up a small distance of
woods and throwing the trees into crazy relief.
Three shells, large ones, raced each other over
the enemy lines. They struck with a clatter, as
if they had felled half of the forest. All along
the line long-range rifles fired their huge bolts of
explosives toward the enemy. Small seventy-fives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
barked like little dogs running after an
automobile. In retaliation the shrill shriek of
the German shells answered. On both sides the
batteries continued pounding away. An orderly,
parting the brush and making a noise like
a stampede of wild horses, appeared and asked
to be directed to the company commander.
Five minutes afterward the platoon was given
orders to move forward. To the tune of heavy
artillery battering away like enormous drums
the platoon, joined at each end by other units
of the division, felt its way blindly through the
forest. When the sun rose they were still
working their way through the trees. Unexpectedly
the guns in the rear of the moving lines
stopped. The battle of Soissons had begun.</p>

<p>The platoon was first apprised of the nearness
of the enemy when King Cole raised his rifle
and fired quickly. He had seen a soiled gray
uniform skirting among the trees a few yards
ahead. A quick electric shock ran from shoulder
to shoulder along the advancing line. The
platoon stopped for a moment as if stunned.
Then they advanced without increasing their
pace. In their faces a machine-gun spat angrily,
the bullets flying past like peevish wasps.
Automatic rifles were manipulated in the middles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the automatic rifle squad, and the loaders
took their places at the sides of the men
who were firing, jamming in one clip of cartridges
after another. Rifle bullets fled past
the advancing men with an infuriating zing.
The Maxim machine-guns kept up a rolling
rat-t-t-tat, coldly objective.</p>

<p>The platoon had reached the first machine-gun
nest, almost without knowing it. There
were three Germans, their heavy helmets sunk
over their heads, each performing a definite part
in the firing. They, too, were surprised. Pugh,
a little in the lead, drew a hand-grenade from
his pocket, pulled out the pin, and threw it in
their faces. It burst loudly and distinctly.
One German fell flat, another grasped at his
arm, his face taking on a blank expression as he
did so, while the last man threw his hands
above his head. Inattentive to his gesture of
surrender, the line pushed on.</p>

<p>The fighting grew more furious. Germans,
surprised, were hiding behind trees and firing
their slow-working rifles. When the advancing
line would reach them they would receive a
charge of shot in their bodies, sometimes before
they had fired at the swiftly moving line.
Some member of the platoon offered his version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of an Indian war whoop. It was successful in
hastening the attack. Exhilarated, but sheerly
impotent, one man ran forward blubbering,
“You God-damn Germans,” and pointing an
empty rifle at the trees. Other men calmly and
methodically worked the bolts of their rifles back
and forth, refilling the chambers as they were
emptied of each clip of five shots. From time
to time a man dropped, thinning the ranks and
spreading them out to such an extent that contact
on the right side of the moving line was
lost.</p>

<p>Farther on in the woods a small trench had
been dug, but through the fierceness and unexpectedness
of the attack most of the enemy had
been driven from it. The platoon, moving on
feet that felt like wings, dashed toward the
trench, some of the men sprawling into it. Before
them, a few yards distant, a machine-gun
poked its nose from between the crevice of two
large rocks. The sight of it infuriated Lieutenant
Bedford, who was leading the platoon by a
few paces. Then, yards away, he began throwing
bombs at it. His last bomb exhausted, he
aimed his pistol and chucked the remaining
shots at it. Now, almost able to look over the
top of the rock and see the gunner, he threw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
useless pistol at the heavy steel helmet. The
gunner dropped his head, covering it with his
hands. When he looked up, the platoon had
passed. Farther, the resistance grew less. The
bombardment of the night before had taken its
toll of Germans. Bodies lay gawkily about on
the grass. One body, headless, clutched a clay
pipe between its fingers. Another lay flat on
its back, a hole in its stomach as big as a hat.
A heavy leather pack, which a shell had struck,
was the centre of a ring of packages of Piedmont
cigarettes which its owner had salvaged
from some dead American.</p>

<p>The trees became sparse. Ahead, over an interminably
long wheat-field, the platoon could
see the horizon. There were no Germans in
sight. The platoon, ordered to do so, faced in
the direction from which they had come and
combed the woods for machine-gun nests which
they might have passed unnoticed during the
attack.</p>

<p>In their poignant hunger the men forgot even
to look for pieces of German equipment which
they might sell to Y. M. C. A. men and others
of the personnel behind the lines. But each
leather German pack was searched for food,
and canteens were picked up, shaken, and either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
thrown down with disgust or hastily put to the
men’s lips and greedily drained of whatever
might be in them. There were loaves of black
bread which, in spite of the mouldy look that
was common to them all, were devoured; an
occasional comb of honey was found. Pugh,
exploring one of the packs, drew forth a pair of
baby stockings and a small knitted hood. Beside
the pack lay a peaceful-looking, home-loving
German who had passed his middle years.</p>

<p>“Here’s an orphan, all right!” Pugh announced,
and went to the next pack.</p>

<p>They were nearing a clump of bushes when a
young German stepped out. His face was the
color of putty and his eyes brought to Hicks
the picture of an escaped convict hunted by
bloodhounds in a Southern swamp. His hands
were high above his head, as high as their
frightened nerves would permit them to be.
At the sight of him an uncouth, illiterate tatterdemalion
from the south of Illinois snarled
half animal-like, raised his rifle to his shoulder
and fired directly at the prisoner. A look of
surprise, utter unbelief, came over the man’s
face as he dropped heavily to the ground.
“Damn ye, that’ll larn ye ta stay hum.”
The fellow, his thin evil face grimaced with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hatred, walked over and spat expertly a stream
of tobacco juice at the already dead body.
The rest of the platoon looked on nonplussed,
not knowing whether their comrade had done
the ethical thing or not.</p>

<p class="tb">Hot and tired, knowing nearly every need of
the body, the platoon was formed near the
place where they had entered the woods late the
night before, as the sun was sinking out of
sight.</p>

<p>They arrived at a crossroads and turned to
the right. Thick woods, green at the fringe and
black within, walled the smooth white ribbon
of road on either side. Through soft, fluffy
clouds that floated over an inanely blue sky the
sun volleyed rays of brilliant light. Small,
shiny pebbles, reflecting the glint, were transformed
into pretty baubles of crystal and amber.</p>

<p>On the right of the road, moving forward in
an unbroken stream, plodded a single file of
drab-colored men. From a distance the line
looked like a swaying, muddy snake. In the
middle of the road, also moving forward, black,
roan, and sorrel horses pulled caissons, field
kitchens, and supply wagons. Men, returning
from the direction in which the main traffic was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
moving, were on the left. They passed by, dejected,
vapid-minded, a look of dull pain in the
eyes of each. They were the wounded from the
attack. Most spectacular among them were
the French Colonials, with their red kepis, their
broad chests showing strength and endurance
beneath their blue or tan tunics. Occasionally
a mass of white, blood-stained gauze would be
wrapped around a black, shiny head, and strong
white teeth would be doggedly bared with pain.
The small carbines and long knives that they
carried set them off as a special sort of troops.
And then the French, with their horizon-blue
uniforms and drooping, inevitable mustaches.
Shoulders sagging, they slouched along with
bandaged heads and bandaged arms. And the
gray of the German uniform and the thump,
thump of the leather boots that they wore.
Small, hideous caps, round and gray, with a
thin red piping circling the top, set awkwardly
on their heads, which rose from thick fat necks.
Behind them walked surly, wary Frenchmen.
A number of English troops were scattered
through the unending line. Beside the Americans
whom they passed their khaki uniforms
looked smart and tailored. In this multicolored
canyon no words were exchanged. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Colonials looked sullen, the French beaten and
spiritless, the Americans dogged and conscientious,
the English expressionless; the Germans
seemed the most human of them all. For them
the fighting was finished.</p>

<p>Miles from the place where the platoon had
alighted from the camions another road split
the deep wall of green forest, and at the crossing
a large farmhouse stood in the middle of a large
field. Whitewashed, all but the roof, it looked
like a cheap but commodious burial vault, with
the yard in the rear filled high with dead and
wounded. The first place of shelter from the
actual front, it was being used as a dressing
station for the maimed. Many of the men
brought back wounded had died there; in a pile
made like carelessly thrown sticks of wood their
bodies now lay. There those whom an imaginary
line had named Friend and Enemy shared
a common lot. German bodies and Austrian
mingling and touching French, Belgian; their
positions a gruesome offering to the God of
War. All day long the heavy hobnailed boots
of hurriedly advancing men had beaten out a
requiem.</p>

<p>The platoon filed along to the left upon the
cross-road, marching as swiftly as their tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
legs would permit. The stream of wounded had
stopped. The field kitchens and supply wagons
had turned off in the woods in rear. For miles
sounded the baffled roar of firing artillery. Now
and then a man fell out alongside the road, unable
to march any longer, the cool green of the
grass in the late afternoon offering a tantalizing
bed. From behind them commenced a great
clatter of caissons drawn jerkily along the shell-torn
road by galloping, lathered horses. Artillerymen,
one on the back of the leading horse,
two on the caisson seat, urged the horses forward
with picturesque curse words, only stopping
long enough to shout at the platoon:</p>

<p>“Better hurry up, you guys, or we’ll git to
Germany before you will.” They rumbled
away.</p>

<p>In a twilight of mauve the platoon came to a
halt on the crest of a broad hill. Silently they
deployed, mud-caked ghosts, dragging wearily
and uncertainly out in a long line that offered
its front to the challenging boom of the enemy’s
long-range guns. Water was found in a spring
near by, and the men lay down in the shallow
holes that they had dug, their blankets and
ponchos thrown over them. A solitary sentry
watched the stars, watched the red, the green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the blue-and-white signal lights flare for a moment
along the line, then die away.</p>

<p class="tb">The gray spirit of dawn rose and hovered over
the ground. In the faint light a unit of cavalry
filed past. The riders, on delicate, supple
mounts, carried long lances, with their points
skyward. On their blue helmets bright, feathery
plumes fell back gracefully. Their spotless
uniforms, gray in the morning light, set off their
youthful figures like those of pages attending a
mediæval court. The horses, their fine legs
delicately contoured, minced daintily down the
hill and out of sight.</p>

<p>Ahead, through a scattered line of trees,
stretched a spacious prairie, covered thick with
wheat,—a slightly rolling sea, majestically and
omnipotently engulfing the universe.</p>

<p>The platoon rose stiffly, bewildered, rubbing
the stiffness from their faces. Over the calm
of the air a danger was borne. Men smelled it
in the acrid odor of powder which covered the
grass. The trees, a thin line before them,
swayed poignantly. Lorelei, singing seductively,
sat in their branches. In attack formation
the platoon moved toward the trees, to the
front toward which they were moving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the trees a narrow path ran parallel.
Reaching it, the platoon turned to the left,
tramping heavily toward the main road from
which they had come the night before.</p>

<p>Scuffing the dust with lagging feet, the platoon
crawled along the dusty road, lined on each
side by contorted faces of men who had come
to support the line of attack. Farther down
the road a small town lay half hidden in the
valley. Long, slender smoke-stacks rose amid
a cluttering of small deserted houses, where,
twenty-four hours earlier, German soldiers had
been quartered. Through one of the chimneys
of the factory a three-inch shell had ploughed its
way, stopping with the nose protruding from
one side, the butt from the other. There it was
suspended, implicit in its obedience. Interminably
long words were printed on signs over
the doors of the houses. At a street crossing
the old names of the thoroughfares had been
blotted out, and such names as Kaiserstrasse
and Wilhelmstrasse were roughly lettered over
them. There was a touch of impiety, of great
barbarousness, in the changing of names which
for so long had been honored. Also a very
strong suggestion of a sound, thorough business
administration having been instituted in place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the lax, pleasant manner of the village before
the war. A peculiar, disagreeable odor hinted
at great and ruthless thrift. The Germans had
been careful of their dead. None remained lying
on the street.</p>

<p>The platoon wound through the town and out
upon the wheat-field which that morning they
had viewed through the scraggly trees. Dazzling
sunlight beat upon the full-topped yellow
heads of wheat that weighted down the cool
green stalks; on the flat, absurdly shaped helmets
of the soldiers; on the sharp white bayonets
raised above the wheat with which the
field was filled. Deploying, the men halted,
joined on either side by other men with silly-looking
helmets, rifles, and bayonets.</p>

<p>From the road a small tank labored up the
hill, puffing and creaking in every joint. Another
tank, a miniature of the tanks pictured in
the recruiting posters, wheezed along on its caterpillar
tread. More tanks came. They were
all small, ineffectual-looking little monsters,
wearing a look of stubborn, gigantic babies.
The arrival of the tanks was greeted by the firing
of a salvo of shells from the German lines.</p>

<p>The platoon lay down in the wheat, trying to
shield their bodies from the sight of the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
But the tanks, wheeling and rearing and grinding
like devils gnashing their teeth, made perfect
targets for the long-range shells. With their
small, ridiculous gun-barrels pointing in three
directions through holes in their steel armor,
they were delightfully impervious to the havoc
they were causing the infantry. And their silly
camouflage, into the making of which some
painter had put his soul—reds and greens, the
colors of autumn leaves, black and modest
browns—in all their disguise they were as apparent
at a distance of one thousand yards as
large white canvases with black bull’s-eyes and
rings scored on them. For an everlasting half-hour
they ploughed and squirmed through the
field, struggling to get into position in order that
the attack might commence. Meanwhile shells,
timed like the ticking of a clock, fell with horrible
and spirit-shaking accuracy. At last the
tanks had manœuvred themselves into the
proper distance ahead of the front line. Whistles
were blown piercingly. The advance, the
men aligned in four waves, had commenced.</p>

<p class="tb">Hicks, lying in the wheat, divided his attention
between the manœuvring of the tanks and
the frantic scampering of the insects on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ground and in the wheat, whose manner of existence
he had disturbed by his sitting down.
Black little creatures, they waddled over the
ground with as great a seriousness and importance
as if they supported the burden of the
world. Disorganized, they ran in all directions,
even toward Hicks’s hobnailed boots and upon
his awkwardly rolled puttees. It was the first
time since he had enlisted that he had thought
much about bugs, save for the kind that infest
the body. Now he wondered whether their
lives were not as important as the lives of men;
whether they were not conscious of a feeling
that, were they no longer to exist, the end of
the world would come. He compared them
with the hustling, inane little tanks, and almost
concluded that one was as important as the
other. He stood by carefully so as not to step
on any of the insects.</p>

<p>So far the German shells had burst either far
behind the platoon or far in front of it. But
now the whine, ever increasing, of a shell informed
him that in a moment he would be listening
to the ripping sound of flying pieces of
shell casing. He waited, breathless. Fifteen
yards behind him the shell exploded terrifically.
He looked back. “Oh, Larson,” he called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Larson was nowhere to be seen. “Damn these
tanks,” he fretted. “They’ll have us all killed,
first thing we know.”</p>

<p>The dread of the attack was forgotten in the
more immediate danger of the enemy artillery
finding the exact range of the platoon by means
of the sputtering tanks. A flock of shells left
the long, black mouths of the German guns and
began their journey toward Hicks. He winced,
tied his muscles into knots, and threw himself
flat on the ground, quite forgetful of the insects.
The shells all struck within a radius of twenty
yards, throwing up dirt, grain, a black cloud
of smoke. The whistle blew and Hicks rose
again.</p>

<p>As he started forward, abreast of the first
wave, he had never before felt so great a stiffness
in his legs, nor so great a weight in his
shoes. It was as if they were tied to the earth.
For a moment the jargon and melody of a
once-popular song flooded his brain. Then he
thought of the platoon joke about the man
from the wilds who had come barefoot to a recruiting
officer to enlist, and who, upon putting
on a pair of shoes, had stood still for hours, believing
that he was tied. “Ha,” thought Hicks,
“that’s a funny one. They had to put sand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
his shoes before he would move.” War was a
business of tightening things, he observed, as
he fastened the chin strap of his helmet more
tightly. Corroborating the evidence, he tightened
his belt over his empty stomach. The
men were marching along, an interval of three
yards between each. A shell struck directly
upon the moving front wave a few yards to the
left of Hicks. An arm and a haversack foolishly
rose in the air above the cloud of smoke of the
exploding shell. Slightly farther on machine-guns
began an annoying rat-tat-tat, the bullets
snipping off the heads of grain. More men fell.
The front rank went on with huge gaps in it.
On they stolidly marched. Hicks, glancing
back, saw that the four waves had been consolidated
into but two. But the bayonets glistened
as brightly as before.</p>

<p>“Close in there, Hicks,” somebody yelled,
and Hicks asked whether the men were not
being killed swiftly enough, without grouping
them together more closely. They advanced to
a point where they were enfiladed by the enemy’s
machine-guns. As the four lines had become
two, so now the two lines became one.
But on they marched, preserving a line that
could have passed the reviewing stand on dress
parade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond a cluster of trees was a village which
had been named as the objective of the attack
for that day. The road, canopied by green tree
boughs, led to it from the town which that
morning the platoon had left. The road was
level, more level even than the field. It made
a path as directing as a bowling-alley for the
machine-gunners and riflemen in the village.
Thus, the road was almost a certain death-trap
for any one who tried to cross it. The right
section of the platoon had begun the attack on
one side of the road, the left on the other. As
the ranks thinned and a greater distance between
each man was required to preserve contact
with the advancing line, the men on the
right, where the heavier firing occurred, spread
out, drawing away from the road.</p>

<p>The shells continued to fall, using as their target
the slowly moving tanks which regulated
the advance of the infantry. Suddenly a large
six-inch shell struck the turret of the tank nearest
the platoon. The tank recoiled and stood
stock-still. A moment later two men, like
frightened rabbits, scurried out of the tank and
ran back toward the rear.</p>

<p>Three airplanes, white stars in a field of red
on their wings, flew gaily over the field and
toward the German lines. They floated gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and haughtily out of sight. Not much
later on they precipitately returned with three
Fokkers after them like angry hornets. Shriven
of their grandeur, they flocked in disorder back
to their hangars, the machine-guns of the German
planes spitting bullets after them. The
aerial entertainment was changed: Four large
German bombing planes, pursuing a businesslike
course, arrived above the advancing men and
began to drop bombs and fire machine-gun bullets
at them. The bombs reported as noisily
as the seventy-seven-millimetre guns, but they
made only a shallow hole in the ground. More
devastating were the machine-gun bullets which
zinged off the steel helmets of the men or bored
their way through to the skull. Under the
combination of direct artillery fire, enfilade
machine-gun, rifle sniping, bombs dropped from
airplanes, the ranks of the advancing men had
become so sparse that the attack was brought
to a temporary halt.</p>

<p>It was now afternoon and the heat of the sun
was unendurable. It burned upon the helmets
and through the clothing and caused sweat to
trickle down the skin, irritating the scratches,
bruises, and burns with which the bodies of the
men were covered. The four bombing planes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
continued lazily to circle overhead, “kicking out
their tail-gates,” as the men graphically phrased
it. Hicks and Pugh, with four of the new men,
were at the farthest point of advance. Lying
flat, they tried with their bayonets, their mess
knives, to throw up a protection of ground in
front of them. Thoroughly tired, they worked
slowly, in spite of the danger. They were half-way
finished when a bullet zipped through the
wheat and penetrated the bone of the crooked
elbow with which the man next Hicks was supporting
himself.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said Hicks, picking up a small
steel-jacketed bullet.</p>

<p>“By God, that hurts. Help me get my shirt
off.”</p>

<p>“Je’s, you’re lucky,” Hicks murmured enviously.
“You’ll never come back to the front
any more. And what a fancy place to get hit!”
The shirt off, the bullet was seen to have gone
through the forearm just above the elbow, coming
out on the other side.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so?” eagerly. “It don’t
hurt so much.”</p>

<p>“No, but you better hurry up and git outa
here or you’ll have somep’n more than a busted
arm,” one of the new men advised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrival of a salvo of shells decided the new
man upon an immediate departure. Throwing
away all of his equipment, he hurried away, his
elbow pressed closely to his side.</p>

<p>Behind Hicks, a few yards, some one began
to whimper.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, buddy?”</p>

<p>“I d-d-on’t kn-now,” the voice stuttered, half
sobbing, half crying.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you beat it back?”</p>

<p>“I’m af-f-fraid.”</p>

<p>“Damn it, get the hell out of here. Do you
want us to go nutty with your bawlin’!” This
from one of the new men.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a good excuse to go back, you
know,” Hicks assured. “Go back with Hensel.
A wounded man’s supposed to have somebody
go back with him.”</p>

<p>“I c-c-can’t-t. I went b-back once s-s-shell-shocked,
and the d-doctors raised hell with me.
I’m af-f-frai-d-d to go back again.” The man
started to laugh unpleasantly. His laughter
changed to violent sobbing. The men grew
doubly frightened. “I can’t stay here and hear
that,” one of them said. “It takes all the
starch out of me.” But he didn’t move.</p>

<p>Near the road King Cole lay upon the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
his lips pressed against the dirt. By his head
his hands were clinched, the knuckles flat. His
helmet had fallen forward so that it covered
his brow, but not the back of his head. His legs
were as rigid as death. On his right leg the
puttee had become unwound, the spiral-shaped
cloth stringing out behind. The leather, worn
through by much marching, a glimpse of his
bare foot appeared where the sole of his shoe
had worn through. His shirt was tattered, and
in the middle of his back a large hole had been
blown. Surprisingly, there was very little blood
on his shirt or upon any other part of his body,
save where the gaping hole showed the raw
flesh. Hours earlier King Cole had been struck
by the explosion of a shell. Since then he had
lain—alive.</p>

<p class="tb">A molten mass of flaming gold all day, the
sun, from sheer exhaustion of vengeful burning,
dropped weakly out of sight. Declining, it filled
the sky with mauve and purple, gold and crimson
designs. Swaying mournfully in the wisps
of evening wind, the full heads of grain were like
slender lances raised by an army of a million
men. The village ahead, toward which the platoon
had advanced within a distance of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
hundred yards, was a vague blur against the
soft gray sky.</p>

<p>It was an hour before nightfall, and firing
along the front had partly ceased. The men in
the advance line were lying prone, thankful for
the surcease offered by the approaching night.
Heard behind them was a swishing sound.
Hicks turned, forgot even for the moment the
piteous moans of the shell-shocked man when
he saw troops swiftly walking.</p>

<p>“We’re going to be relieved. We’re going to
be relieved.” The thought pounded through
his brain. The oncoming troops were now near
and distinct. Hicks could see the red, brimless
stovepipe hats, the black, shiny faces, the picturesque
and decorated tunics of the Foreign
Legion. They carried small rifles and long
knives and looked frightfully dangerous. Hicks
reflected that these were the fellows who were
supposed to treasure the ears of the enemy as
keepsakes. Swiftly, their huge leg muscles
bulging under their puttees, they walked
through the wheat and passed. Hicks felt dismal.</p>

<p>“Relief, hell. They’re going to attack.”</p>

<p>And they were. As silent as ghosts they fled
straight for the village. The enemy, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
them, opened up with their rifles and machine-guns
with extraordinary furiousness. The black
soldiers advanced unhesitatingly. Some of
them dropped flat, never to rise again of their
own volition; others clasped a hand to the part
of the body where a bullet had entered and
turned back, walking quickly and nervously, but
failing to speak. Hicks had never seen so many
men wounded without their exclaiming. Usually,
when some American was struck he would
cry some such absurdly obvious statement as
“Oh, my God, I’m hit.” A German would
shriek his inevitable “Kamerad.” A Frenchman
would jabber. But these fellows—Hicks
marvelled. But the remaining five hundred
yards were too difficult to cross. Where five
of the fleet blacks set valiantly forth, but one of
them returned.</p>

<p class="tb">Darkness fell, closing the world in on four
sides. Off to the left, on the farther side of the
road, a tank suddenly and unexpectedly burst
forth with an internal explosion. Its grim little
body showed solidly in the glorious blazing
red. The report that followed sounded as if
the armor of the tank would have been burst
into a million pieces. Up shot another flare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
redness, brightening the sky. As if there were
some understanding among them, two other
tanks began, at regular intervals, to belch their
fireworks into the air. It was a wondrous sight.
Far enough away not to be harmful, it had also
the advantage of being a spectacle uninspired
by malice or hatred. It was a thing in itself,
a war of its own, in which nobody shared, totally
objective, non-utilitarian and spontaneous.
Hicks gleefully considered the sight. But after
a while the side-show stopped and the dampness
stole through the clothing of the men. A lone
star twinkled forth, trembled violently for a
moment and then disappeared. In the heat of
the day many of the platoon had thrown away
their blankets. Now they lay shivering with
cold and fear and hopelessness.</p>

<p>Over the wheat-field the night mist hung like
a thick, wet, flapping blanket. Elephantine, it
touched against the faces of the men, sending
shivers along their spines. Machine-gun bullets
spattered perfunctorily. The shell-shocked man
moaned like a banshee. Disgusted, feeling as
if his stomach were about to crawl away from
his body, Hicks rose, deciding to cross the road
and find out whether there was any possibility
of relief before dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other side of the road the ground was
softer and the men had dug deeper holes. The
little mounds of freshly thrown dirt were hardly
perceptible.</p>

<p>“Where’s Lieutenant Bedford?” Hicks asked
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Dead as hell,” he was answered.</p>

<p>“Then who’s in charge?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that, Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Yeh.”</p>

<p>“When are we going to be relieved?”</p>

<p>“We’re standing by now. They ought to be
here any minute.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s so, I’m gonna take my squad
back. We’re pretty bad off, way up there, and
one of the new fellows is making such a hell of
a lot of noise that I’m afraid the Squareheads
will begin firing again.”</p>

<p>“’Smatter with him?”</p>

<p>“Shell-shocked, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’d better shove off.”</p>

<p>Hicks felt his way back through the darkness,
through the curtain of mist.</p>

<p>Supporting the weaker man between them,
the small party moved off, with Hicks in the
lead. He was travelling lightly, with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
equipment. At the first of the advance he had
thrown away his pack, containing an empty
condiment can and three boxes of hard bread.
Finally he had disposed of all but his pistol,
belt, canteen, helmet, and respirator. Leaving,
he threw away his automatic rifle and the
musette bag in which ammunition was supposed
to be carried. He walked along, his chin high,
stepping briskly through the hip-high wheat.
Somewhere beyond was rest and security, warm
food, and plenty of blankets.</p>

<p>It irked him that the rest of the squad did not
walk as swiftly as he walked. His ears seemed
to flatten against his head at being held back.
The distance was so alluring. It promised so
many things of which his body was in want.
There was the hot coffee. Hicks fancied that
he could smell the soul-satisfying aroma of it.
He remembered that the American army little
knew the value of coffee to the man who is cold
and tired and awake in the early dawn. But
there would be, no doubt, French galleys, with
black kettles in which they brewed strong black
chicory. Hot coffee! He thought of it and
felt ready to faint. At any moment a shell
might drive into the ground near him and blow
him high in the air. Reins seemed fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
his shoulders, holding them back, delaying his
progress. He wanted to cry out against the inhumanity
of being forced to walk so slowly in
so dangerous a place after the work in hand was
done. He thought of forging ahead, of leaving
the blubbering man to himself. He measured
the distance back to the woods and guessed the
length of time it would take to arrive. An hour
at the most. But if he ran he could make it in
half an hour. The responsibility of the safety
of the squad held him back. Revolted at his
cowardly thoughts, he offered to help carry the
burden. The men objected. “You lead the
way.” But he was insistent. With one arm
of the blubbering, nerveless mass around his
neck, he forged ahead, feeling powerful and exultant
under the added weight.</p>

<p>Whining lazily over their heads, gas shells
soared and struck softly in the town in front of
them. They reached the valley and passed
down into the town. Over the ground and on
the weeds a coating of yellow had formed. The
air was heavy with an asphyxiating smell. The
yellow from the ground bit through the puttees
and penetrated the clothing; the odor was inhaled
in deep gulps that caused the men to
choke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment of indecision in which
the men hesitated between putting on their
respirators, thereby retarding their steps, and
hurrying through the town, their lungs exposed
to the poisonous gas. With the shells continuing
to come over in droves, it was not difficult
to decide. The men breathed in the gas.</p>

<p>Had they not, they would not have seen the
aperture in the side of the gulley, where a gas
blanket covered a dugout filled with wounded.
There they stopped, while Hicks informed the
receiving officer that their burden had been
badly gassed. He said nothing about his being
shell-shocked.</p>

<p>Relieved of the great impedimenta, their
progress quickened, and they were through the
town almost as soon as they could have wished.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p>Before daybreak they arrived at the
woods where the battalion had been ordered
to assemble. On entering the woods,
Hicks was halted by one of the company lieutenants
who had offered to remain out of the
attack in order that, should the company be annihilated,
he would be able to form the nucleus
of another company with the orderlies of the
officers, the soiled assistants of the kitchen, and
the like. Hicks, having thrown away most of
his equipment, had annexed on the road to the
woods parts of uniforms of all descriptions. On
his head was a bright red kepi which formerly
had belonged to a French Colonial. A pair of
soft leather boots that reached above the calves
of his legs had been salvaged from some officer’s
bedding roll. His blouse had been discarded
and his shirt was unbuttoned at the
throat. Hanging in cowboy fashion, a forty-five
calibre Colt flapped against his right hip.
From his left side was a Luger pistol that he
had taken from a dead German officer.</p>

<p>Thus, he was a sight that no strictly military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
officer who had received at least ninety days’
training in learning the commands of squads
right, slope and shoulder arms, at some officers’
training school could bear.</p>

<p>“Private!” the officer shouted indignantly.
“What are you doing out of uniform?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>Truthfully, Hicks did not know. He only
knew that he had thrown away much of his own
equipment and that he was highly pleased with
the equipment he had substituted for it.</p>

<p>“Don’t know?” The officer was scandalized.
“Private, how long have you been in the
service?”</p>

<p>“Since war was declared,” Hicks answered
promptly.</p>

<p>“And you don’t yet know how to dress?
Nor how to address an officer? Private, you
have not saluted me!” The officer was horror-stricken;
his tone suggested an utter unbelief
in Hicks’s existence.</p>

<p>“You don’t salute officers at the front, sir.”</p>

<p>The officer turned green. “Private, consider
yourself under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.” Hicks started to walk
away.</p>

<p>“And private,” the officer called. “If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
aren’t back in uniform by the next time I see
you, a charge of disobedience will be added to
your offense.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” Hicks muttered, walking
away.</p>

<p>He sought out the coolest-looking spot in the
woods and there lay down. In a moment he
was asleep. In another moment he was awakened
by a terrific noise. Unwittingly, he had
selected for his bed a space not ten yards from
where a battery of long-range guns were concealed.
When they were fired the earth shook.
He rose and fled farther into the woods.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, at the side of a green knoll,
several old Frenchmen were pottering around a
field kitchen. The coals of the wood fire under
a huge black kettle glowed in a warming,
friendly fashion. The aroma of black, satisfying
coffee steamed from the wide mouth of the
caldron. Hicks was enchanted, powerless to
move, afraid to approach the benignant genii.
He felt like a vagrant, nose pressed against the
window of a fashionable restaurant. But no,
not like a vagrant. Vagrants were only in
cities, in blessed civilizations. He was still undecided,
when one of the squat little figures,
that somehow reminded him of the characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in “Rip Van Winkle,” looked up. To Hicks he
spoke unintelligibly, but his voice was not
forbidding. Hicks came nearer. He sniffed.
“Café?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Oui, café,” the man grunted, going on about
his business.</p>

<p>“Café bon,” offered Hicks.</p>

<p>“Oui. Café bon, très bon,” the man conceded.</p>

<p>“J’ai faim.”</p>

<p>“O pardon. Vous avez faim. Voulez-vous
café?” He scooped a ladleful of hot coffee
from the caldron and offered it to Hicks. How
simple it was, Hicks thought, as he drained
the dipper.</p>

<p>The men gathered around Hicks. “Américain,
oui?” They apparently had decided before
offering the question. “Pas Anglais? Anglais
mauvais.”</p>

<p>They learned that he had been in the attack.
“Boche pas bon aussi, non?”</p>

<p>From their bags cakes of chocolate and slices
of bread were brought and offered. Hicks ate
shyly but greedily.</p>

<p>They were the first Frenchmen whom he had
tried to talk with since the day of the first attack
of his platoon. Then they were disheartened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
not caring whether the Germans drank
beer from the Arc de Triomphe or not. Now
they had regained heart and were willing to
continue the struggle of the advance toward
Germany. Hicks learned that he had engaged
in the initial attack of a vast offensive, that the
goal had been reached, that Soissons had fallen
under the storm of the First and Second Regular
Divisions, that Château-Thierry had at last
been cleared of the enemy by the Third and
Twenty-sixth Divisions, that in between the
Fourth Regular Division had been successful in
its attack. “Fini la guerre?” asked Hicks, and
he was frowned upon by the genii. No, they
informed him, the war had begun anew and
would continue long. The genii spoke of the
black forest, of the Kriemhilde Stellung, which
had never been passed save by Allied prisoners,
of the narrowing front the German retreat
would make. No, the war would last one year,
two years, three years.</p>

<p class="tb">Hicks tramped through the forest, stumbling
over large holes that had been torn in the
ground by the explosions of German long-range
shells. Now all was quiet. The green leaves
of the trees fluttered unperturbed, birds trilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
from joy or shrieked messages to one another.
The boughs of the trees were kind, shielding
the men from the rays of the hot summer sun.
Soldiers were bustling about, tugging ant-like
at heavy caissons which seemed unwilling to
budge.</p>

<p>Thoroughly tired out, men were stretched
upon the cool grass asleep, forgetful of the void
in their stomachs. Suddenly, in the distance, a
very erect form stalked through the trees. As
it approached, a thin, haughty face, above
which a steel helmet jauntily set, was to be seen.
At the sight of him all of the sleeping men arose
as if by a signal earlier agreed upon. The tired,
worn-out, hungry soldiers; the dirty, blood-smeared,
lousy soldiers; the red-eyed, gas-eaten,
mud-caked soldiers; the stupid, yellow, cowardly
soldiers; the pompous, authoritative corporals;
the dreamy, valiant, faithful soldiers rose
to their feet and stood at attention. As the
tall, spare figure advanced nearer, tired hands
were smartly raised to their helmets and dropped
quickly against the thigh.</p>

<p>Was it General Ulysses S. Pershing who had
come? It was not. It was Major Adams,
Major John R. Adams, the battalion commander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“What outfit is this?” The major’s tone
was crisp.</p>

<p>“First battalion of the Sixth, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where are the rest of the men?”</p>

<p>“All the men are here, sir.”</p>

<p>“What! This is not a battalion, it’s a platoon.
That was a hell of a way to let a bunch
of Germans treat you.”</p>

<p>He walked past. The men sank back on the
ground, fully one-fifth of the number that had
attacked.</p>

<p>That afternoon beer was rationed by the mess
sergeant, who had deprived his safe dugout,
far in the rear, of his pleasant company for a
few hours. The mess sergeant admitted that
the beer had been provided by Major Adams.</p>

<p class="tb">On this particular afternoon the woods of Villers
Cotterets was as quiet and peaceful as a
statue of stone. Placid, motionless, the leaves
of the trees looked as if they were made of wax.
Their branches curved solemnly and prayerfully
toward each other, meeting and forming successions
of arches. Planted in perpendicular
rows, they aspired straight and immutable, while
overhead, fat plucked cotton tops, greatly expanded,
lay like dead below an impenetrable expanse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of blue sky. Upon the fragile blades of
grass men were held in the vice of a sleep of exhaustion.
Five miles from the woods the guns
along the front line, where men waited, anxiously
watching the movements of each other,
were silent.</p>

<p>Somewhere among the solemn and still
branches a huge limb cracked. It fell rapidly
and with a horrific sound through the foliage.
Down, down it came, rending the small sprigs of
green as it fell. Below the limb a soldier slept.
When it reached the earth its heavier end struck
the soldier on the head, crushing his skull. Instantly
the scene was changed to one of frenzied
activity. Men leaped to their feet and ran out
of the woods.</p>

<p>The treachery, the unexpectedness of the
calamity remained unshakable in the mind of
Hicks. To him it seemed the height of cruelty,
and in some way he interpreted it as an intentional
act of the enemy. He knew better. He
knew that a shell, probably the day before, during
the heavy bombardment, had struck the
limb and partly severed it, and afterward its
great weight had brought itself down. It
preyed upon him dreadfully. That any one
could have gone through the punishment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
attack unharmed and then have returned to a
place of safety only to be killed was more than
he could stand. It was an act of vengeance,
and he believed it to be the vengeance of an
angry God.</p>

<p>Men returned to the woods from the field
under orders of the officers, who feared that
their presence in the field might attract the attention
of the enemy. Nearly all of them returned
and resumed their sleep. But not Hicks.
He was firmly decided against the woods. He
would be at hand for as many attacks as general
headquarters could devise; he would do his part
in advancing the Allied cause; he would help
save the world for democracy; he would make
war to end war; he would tolerate Y. M. C. A.
secretaries; he would go without food, clothing,
and sleep—so he told the officers—but he would
not return to the woods. He lay down outside
in the wheat, every muscle twitching. For him,
he felt, life had ended, the world had come to a
full stop.</p>

<p>Even the manœuvring of a small German
plane around the big French observation balloon
failed to draw his attention from himself.
The little plane would draw away like some
game-cock, and then dash for the balloon, spurting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a stream of incendiary bullets as it flew,
then draw away again and repeat the operation.
At last the basket of the balloon was located and
the observer was struck by a piece of hot lead.
High above the trees, he leaned from the basket
and dropped, clinging to his parachute.
The parachute caught in the top of one of the
trees. From nowhere a low-hung French automobile,
with three men in the seats, dashed forward
toward the scene. The men got out, and,
after a while, returned with the wounded observer,
the white bandage on his arm showing
distinctly for a distance. But the sight offered
no titillations for Hicks.</p>

<p class="tb">Before dusk the battalion was formed and
orders were given to march back to the line of
reserve. The news that the destination of the
battalion was farther from the front was sceptically
received. The men adopted the pose of
feeling insulted at having been offered so poor
a ruse. “Reserve, my eye. Why don’t they
say we’re goin’ to one of them rest camps you
always hear so much about?”</p>

<p>“Or else tell us that we’re goin’ to get thirty
days’ leave each.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, where’s them boats we was goin’ to see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“We may go in reserve, but it’ll be in reserve
of the Germans.”</p>

<p>Thus they offered their various comments
upon the foolishness of believing that they were
to leave the front.</p>

<p>But the talk was borne on weak wings. For
the moment the men had little interest in their
destination, save that they wanted it to be
near. Their legs felt as if they were to be separated
from their bodies at the groin. Their
feet felt as if their shoes were full of small,
sharp pebbles. Major Adams, leading his horse
and walking beside the men, encouraged them,
saying that they would halt in a short time.</p>

<p>If the battalion as a body troubled little
about where they were going, Hicks cared not
at all. The incident of the falling tree had
broken him. He felt in danger of his life.
Where he went mattered not. There was no
safety anywhere. He tramped along the road,
an atom in the long, lean line, his face showing
white as paper through the dirt.</p>

<p>As night came on and a lopsided moon appeared,
the battalion turned off in a woods,
was halted, and lay down.</p>

<p>In the dark Hicks and Pugh found a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
where the grass was thickest. They spread
out their blankets and lay down. Pugh was
restless, though his body was scourged with
fatigue. His was the foraging spirit. There
were no supply wagons in sight from which to
pilfer, there were no field kitchens, with the
cooks stewing a barely edible mess of tomatoes,
beef-bones, potatoes, and onions. He got
up and silently stole away. Less than an hour
afterward he returned, his arms laden with bottles
and condiments. He uncorked a bottle,
placed the open end under Hicks’s nose, and
gently shook him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hicks, Hicksy, look what daddy’s got.”</p>

<p>Hicks awakened with a start, almost knocking
the bottle from Pugh’s hand.</p>

<p>“Cognac?” Hicks greedily asked.</p>

<p>“Naw,” deprecatingly, “but it’s pretty good
champagne.”</p>

<p>Hicks drank, passed the bottle to Pugh. The
bottle played shuttlecock between them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hicks felt impelled to talk.</p>

<p>“Jack, I’m all in. I feel sort of sick. I don’t
believe I can go up to the front any more.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” sympathetically.
“These Big Berthas got you fooled?”</p>

<p>“No,” thoughtfully. “That isn’t it. I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
stand that all right. I can even stand to see
Kahl and the rest of those fellows get knocked
off. I suppose I could even stand it to get
killed myself. You don’t make such a hell of
a fuss when you get killed. But it seems so
damned ridiculous. Take our going over the
other day. A full battalion starting off and
not even a fifth of them coming back. And
what did they do? What did we do? We never
even saw a German. They just laid up there
and picked us off—direct hits with their artillery
every time! That’s hell, ... you know.
Think of being sent out to get killed, and the
person who sends you not knowing where you’re
going! It looks crazy. Like goin’ up to the
Kaiser and saying: ‘Here, chop my head off.’
And I was talking to a Frog to-day, a Frog that
gave me some coffee, and he said that this
damned thing might keep up for years. Now,
it’d be all right if we could go up and clean
things up with one big smash, but it’s pretty
mean when you go up and come back, go up
and come back, until you get knocked off.
Gimme another drink.</p>

<p>“And Jack, you know that Frog I was tellin’
you about? When he gave me the coffee he
asked me if I was an American. I guess he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
thought at first that I was an Englishman, and
when I told him I wasn’t he looked sort of glad.
Then he looked as if he expected me to agree
with him and said that the Englishmen were
no good.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did, didn’t you? I’d like to take
a crack at them lime-juicers.”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make? The
point is, the French hate the English and the
English hate the Americans and the Americans
hate the Germans, and where the hell is it all
goin’ to end? Gimme another drink.</p>

<p>“I guess that fellow being killed this afternoon
got on my nerves,” he finished.</p>

<p>Hicks drank until he was drunk, not sickeningly
drunk, but until his brain was numbed.</p>

<p>Pugh sat awake, watching the stars through
the trees and listening to one of the new men
singing low some Italian love-songs that he had
learned in Rome.</p>

<p class="tb">The battalion slept until noon. When they
awoke, the field kitchens, drawn up not far
from them, were concocting the rations into
that particular delicacy known to army folk as
slum. The men fell in line before the large
metal containers, where soiled-looking ragamuffins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
slopped a pale, watery substance into
the dirty mess-kits that were held out by the
men as they passed. The bread was white,
there was much coffee that was hot. Further
than that the desires of the men did not
wing.</p>

<p class="tb">Late afternoon found the battalion on the
road again, bound farther from the front.
They knew that they were leaving the front by
the receding boom of the artillery.</p>

<p>They were billeted in a small town from which
all of the able-bodied inhabitants had flown.
Vacant houses were searched out, armsful of
straw were taken from the barns and arranged
in neat piles on the stone floors of the houses.
By sleeping in pairs, they were able to use one
blanket to put over the straw, the other blanket
to cover their bodies.</p>

<p>There began the regular soldier’s formula of
reveille and morning exercises; a scrawny breakfast
and a morning of drill; a heavy, lumpy dinner
and an afternoon of skirmishing, alternating
with lectures on the manœuvres of war; a thin,
skimpy supper, leaving the men free in the evening
to bribe the townspeople to sell them eggs,
salads, rabbit, cognac, and wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Of an evening they would gather in cafés,
small, snug ones, with rough boards for tables
and several broken chairs and talk over the
grievances that the day had brought; of the
rottenness of the Y. M. C. A., upon which all
but two were agreed; of what they did before
they enlisted in “this man’s army”; of the
slackness of the mail delivery; of their hatred
and contempt for the military police, and especially
those military police in Paris of whom
horrifying tales of cruelty were told; of what
they were going to do when they were released
from the army; of the vengeance they were
planning against at least three officers; of how
they were going to circumvent being captured
for the next war. One, now and again, would
shyly bring a pocket-worn photograph forth
and show it to those whom drink had made
his closest friends. In all, a fairly pleasant
existence.</p>

<p>But Hicks was one of the more silent among
them. After the first few nights in the town he
began making long, lonely pilgrimages to near-by
towns and returning later after taps, at
which time he was supposed to be in bed. He
also began drinking more heavily, and one
morning, when the whistle was blown for drill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Hicks was still drunk from the effects of the
liquor of the night before. But being one of
the handful of the original members of the
platoon, little by way of reprimand was said.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p>Immensely imposing by greatness of numbers,
three divisions were gathered in ranks
on the field. Presenting a huge sight of restless
attention, they swayed like the waves of a mud-colored
sea. Before them an officer stood on a
platform, his hat in his hand, the wind blowing
his hair. Not far off, on the outskirts of a ramshackle
village, old Frenchmen, their wives, and
their grandchildren watched. The officer lifted
his hand with a gesture, commanding a silence
that none could mistake. He hunched up his
shoulders and frowned disapproval; he fastened
his thumbs in the strap of his belt. His protuberant
belly kept him from being an exact
replica of an old turkey-cock. Now, tearing to
shreds the phlegm in his gullet, he opened his
mouth:</p>

<p>“Men, no doubt some of you, most of you,
believe that you are here by chance. That any
divisions might have been called in place of
you. Men, you are not here by chance. It is
because I, personally, requested our distinguished
commanding officer that your divisions
make up my army corps that you are here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he paused. He was a major-general
and he was wondering how much longer the
war would last, hoping that it would continue
through the year.</p>

<p>“I have watched you enter the lines, green
and unseasoned troops, at Cantigny and Château-Thierry,
and assault the enemy with such
force that you threw back his most valiant
troops, the Prussian Guards. You have shown
your sterling mettle at Soissons and Saint
Mihiel, advancing far beyond the objective
given you. Jaulny and Thiaucourt and Montfaucon
have fallen under your irresistible onslaught.
Now you may be considered, you are
considered, wherever civilization is known, as
shock troops, second in valor to none.”</p>

<p>He paused, wondering irresistibly whether his
impending rise to lieutenant-general would give
his wife access into the more imposing homes
of Washington.</p>

<p>“And so you are here, good soldiers who have
done your duty and are willing to do it again.</p>

<p>“Many of you men came over to France with
the belief that the war would soon be over and
you would return home again to indulge in your
inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness.” (“Hooray!” shouted the men.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
“You will return home soon, but not as soon
as you expected. Not until we have pierced
the enemy lines and brought them to our feet.”
(“Take him out—to hell with you—how does
he get that way”—the muttered comments rose
indistinctly from the sea of mud.) “It depends
upon you men right here as to how long you
will stay in France. You can stay until hell
freezes over or you can renew your good work
and be home before you know it. Our commanding
general has said: ‘Hell, Heaven, or
Hoboken by Christmas,’ and it is up to us to
stand by him.” (“Oh, my God—let’s go home—we’re
hungry—chow”—ending in a dull
chanting, “When do we eat?”)</p>

<p>The general was going along famously. He
felt his gift of rhetoric as he never before had
felt it. His eyes dimmed and a lump rose in
his throat at the frenzied cheering of the men.</p>

<p>“You men are assembled here to-day to be
told of the great offensive in which you will
soon take part. Many of you will not return
from it, but that is war. Some of you will
come off non-commissioned officers, and, as
should be the case in a democratic army, others
will have a chance to be officers, made so by
an act of Congress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>(“Pipe down—bunk.”)</p>

<p>He believed that he was being cheered again.
He continued his address for fifteen minutes
longer than he intended. When he stepped
from the platform to the ground there were
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>In making the estimates of the divisions before
him, the major-general had only spoken
aloud what the men secretly believed—that they
were the “finest flower of chivalry,” the epitome
of all good soldierly qualities. But to hear
themselves so praised sounded unethical, made
them embarrassed. Had they been told that
they were not shock troops, that they were not
the best soldiers in the known world, they
would have been indignant. Therefore they
hid their gratitude and commendation under a
torrent of mordant remarks. The long lines
were formed into squads, demanding food, speculating
upon the nearness of the attack, as they
marched back to their respective towns where
they were billeted.</p>

<p>Hicks had not recovered from his despondency.
His stomach felt as if he had swallowed
a stone every time reference was made to the
attack. He had done about enough in this
war, he thought, wondering vaguely whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
there were no chance of escape. The thought
of the sound of the guns depressed him, their
monotonous tom-tom beating in memory on his
skull like water dripping slowly on a stone.
Disgusting! And no letters from home, no
change of scene, no clean clothing, nothing but
the hopelessness of routine, the bullying of petty
officers, the prospect of the front.</p>

<p>He was still brooding when the platoon
reached its billets in the town to which it had
come from the last drive. Instead of the unsavory
food steaming under a fire in the field
kitchen, there was an issue of corned beef,
and slabs of black bread to be eaten. The field
kitchens were packed, the supply wagons were
loaded. The persevering little mules that
hauled the machine-gun carts stood waiting.
Orders were passed for the men to pack up their
equipment and be ready to fall into line on the
company street in half an hour. “Shake it up,
you men,” the officers called, walking back and
forth past the buildings. “We haven’t got all
night.” homebody asked where the platoon
was going. “To the front,” an officer answered.
“Make it snappy.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p>For two days now the bombardment had
continued, heaving over the live, huge
shells that broke in the distance with a dull, sullen
fury. Lightly it had begun, and with an exchange
of salutes from the six-inch rifles. Then
a number of batteries in the centre of the sector
started ferociously to bark. Along the left the
heavy detonation of the exploding shells was
taken up, later to be joined by the smaller pieces
of artillery, which went off with mad, snapping
sounds. The guns on the right brought the
entire line into action.</p>

<p>Artillerymen, their blouses off, their sleeves
rolled, sweated in torrents as they wrestled with
shells, throwing them into the breeches of their
guns. Each gun was fired, and as it recoiled
from the charge another shell was waiting to be
thrown into the breech. The officers of the
gunners, their muscles tense, their lineaments
screwed up so that their faces looked like white
walnuts, made quick mathematical calculations,
directing the shells unerringly to strike their
targets. Orderlies hurried from gun-pit to gun-pit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
carrying messages from a higher officer
which, when delivered to the battery commanders
and passed to the gunners, would strike or
spare a hundred men, an old church, or a hospital.</p>

<p>Wagons and heavy motor-trucks rumbled
over the roads leading to the forests where the
long-range guns were hidden, bringing always
more food for the black, extended throats of the
guns. The batteries in the centre had been
drawn up in a thick woods a few miles from the
present front line. There, from the height of a
steady swell in the earth, they were able better
to watch the effects of their pounding.</p>

<p>Between the inky mass of forest which concealed
the guns and the jagged front line were
the crumbling ruins of a village of which not a
building now stood. The ruins were at the
edge of the front line, which zigzagged unendingly
in either direction. Barbed wire, rusted
and ragged, was strung from posts before the
trench. Chevaux-de-frise, inspiring confidence
in their ability to withstand penetration, were
placed at intervals, wherever gaps had been
blown in the barbed wire.</p>

<p>The space between the front line and the
German listening posts was a yellowish gray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Its face was pockmarked and scabbed with tin
cans, helmets, pieces of equipment. Bones,
grayed in the sun and rain, were perceptible occasionally.
A leather boot stuck grotesquely
out of one of the unhealthy indentations in the
lifeless ground. The flat chrome earth lay for
several hundreds of yards and then was split by
a strip of shadowy black woods.</p>

<p>Past the woods the barren earth continued,
rising and disappearing at a distance, in a hill
studded with trees.</p>

<p>Beyond lay mystery and a gargantuan demon
who, taking whatever shape he chose, might
descend with a huge funnelled bag from which
he might extract any number of fascinatingly
varied deaths.</p>

<p>The night before, out of a still, starlit sky, a
sudden rain had fallen. It had drenched the
trees and the grass and soaked the clothing of
the troops who were lying in the woods awaiting
the hour for the attack. The rain made a long,
slimy, muddy snake out of the roads leading to
the front line. Where the caisson tracks had
bitten into the ground, hasty rivulets now ran.
Water from the evenly plotted fields had drained
into the ditch that ran alongside the road, overflowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Bandoliers of ammunition slung over their
shoulders, their pockets stuffed with heavy corrugated
hand-grenades, carrying shovels and
picks, the platoon followed along the muddy
road in rear of a machine-gun company. Rudely
awakened from an irresistible sleep beneath the
trees, they had been marshalled before supply
wagons, had been given articles of extra equipment
to use in the attack. Now, whenever the
body of troops before them halted, the lids
closed readily over their sleepy eyes and their
bodies swayed with fatigue. The halts were
frequent, for the machine-gunners carried their
heavy rifles and tripods on their shoulders.</p>

<p>The road was slippery and the travel laborious,
and after innumerable pauses whenever the
advancing line became clogged, the men sat
down, completely fatigued, in the mud and
water. Uneasiness could be felt in the tightly
packed mass that waddled along the road. It
lay on the tongues of the platoon, preventing
them from showing their exasperation at the
long delay. Curses would rise to their lips and
die unuttered. A word spoken aloud, the jangling
of metal, would infuriate them. From
fear and habit, the explosion of a gun near them
would cause them to stop, standing without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
tremor. A distance of less than two miles, the
platoon crawled along like an attenuated turtle.
They felt that dawn would find them still on
the road, their feet struggling with the clinging
mud. The night was as thick and black as coal-tar.
Progress through it seemed impossible.</p>

<p class="tb">Behind the barely moving lines the guns continued
their <em>boom, boom</em>, like the sound of distant
thunder. The shells whistled overhead,
the report of their explosion only faintly to be
heard. There was no retaliation. The enemy
seemed willing to take the brunt without a
murmur. But to the platoon their silence was
suspicious. Accustomed to hearing the crashing
reply to a bombardment, when the men did
not hear it they grew fearful. They began to
wonder if they were not being led into a trap.
Fed too fully upon the German-spy propaganda
issued by the Allied governments, they wondered
whether the general directing the attack might
not be a minion of the Kaiser, leading them to
their deaths. Or else the Germans were planning
some great strategic coup.</p>

<p>The failure of the enemy guns to reply was
so annoying that it became the absorbing notion
in the minds of the men. Their ears were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
strained, waiting to hear the familiar whine of
a shell fired toward them. It made their nerves
feel ragged and exposed. On the road sounded
the decisive beat of horses’ hoofs. It was
deeply perturbing. Stretching their necks,
unmindful of the slippery road, the danger
of sliding into the ditch, the men watched the
horse and rider, believing it portentous. The
horse was turned back to the woods.</p>

<p>Like a latrine built for a corps of monsters
stretched the slippery trench. Approaching it
through the narrow communication gully, the
men slid and stumbled from the slatted-board
bottom into the mire. They would withdraw
their legs from the mud, the mud making a
“pflung” as the foot rose above it.</p>

<p>The platoon filed into the trench, and
crouched low against the firing bays their bayonets
peeping over the top. After hours on the
road the trench was warm to their bodies, despite
its mud and slime. Their eyes staring
into the black night, the men waited.</p>

<p>Hard, cold, and unfriendly dawn broke over
the earth like a thin coating of ice shattering in
a wash-basin. In the eerie light the tangled
masses of wire, the weather-beaten posts from
which the wire was strung, the articles of equipment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and clothing once worn by men looked
unreal. The woods ahead, a grayish black, lay
against the sky like a spiked wall.</p>

<p>Hicks, his face pressed against the muddy
side of the trench, felt sick. Along the road his
body had been shaken with chills. Now the
muscles of his stomach were contracting, forcing
him to gag. He thought of poking his
soiled finger down his throat, but the thought
of it was so revolting that he only gagged more
violently.</p>

<p>Crouching there, he had no desire to leave
the trench. Why should he leave it, he asked
himself, and could find no reason. Possibly for
an hour during his whole life he had hated the
German army. Now he only disliked them.
And for one reason: because they marched in a
goose-step. He felt that for any people to
march in that manner was embarrassing to the
rest of humanity. Somehow it severed them
from the rest of their kind. But that was little
reason, he realized, to drag his weary body over
a repulsive ground. He was conscious of a sensation
of numbness.</p>

<p>“Je’s, I’m sick,” he groaned to the man next
to him. “I don’t know whether I can go over.
I’m all in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you go back? Tell one of the
officers. He’ll send you back.”</p>

<p>“Yeh. And have every one of you birds
think I’m yellow? I <em>will</em> not. I’ll be all right,”
he added.</p>

<p>The roar of the guns deepened. A heavy curtain
of exploding shells lay between the platoon
and the German lines. The barrage lifted and
started to move.</p>

<p>Whistles were imperatively blown along the
trench, commanding the men to rise and begin
the advance. As if it were their last mortal act,
the men clambered out of the trench and started
to walk.</p>

<p class="tb">Bent over, like a feeble old man, Hicks walked
abreast of the first wave. His respirator hung
heavily from around his neck. He clutched at
his collar, loosening it more freely to breathe.
His legs were made of wood, they felt light, but
hesitated to bend. His nostrils were being flattened
against his face by huge, unseen thumbs.
“Hell, Heaven, or Hoboken by Christmas,” he
thought, adding “Probably hell for all of us.”</p>

<p>The day brightened, and as he approached
the trees they became separate identities. The
trees stared at him menacingly. They embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
him by their scrutiny. He found himself
making excuses for advancing toward them.
It was exasperating that no bullets were fired
from the trees. He wondered why it could be.
And then he was at the woods, entering with
the rest of the men, and the underbrush parted
with a crackling sound. He drew back, frightened.</p>

<p>Because of the thickness of the underbrush
and the irregularity of the setting of the trees,
he veered off to a path that led through the
woods. On it other men had made their way
and were stealthily tramping through, their eyes
darting from one side to the other.</p>

<p>At a place where another path crossed, an
ammunition wagon stood. The bodies of four
horses lay dead on the ground, their hides mutilated,
pierced by pieces of flying shell. The
dead horses were a squeamish sight, lying there
with large reproachful eyes and slender necks
that seemed to have been broken. Their stomachs
were inflated as if they had eaten too much
fresh clover. Hicks grew more depressed, his
own stomach wanted to describe a parabola inside
of him. Hicks gagged, engaged in a spasm
of retching. The woods were covered with saffron,
their trunks were gaunt, and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
splotches stuck out from the branches. The
grass wore a bilious complexion. He looked
down at his shoes; they, too, were yellow, unfamiliar,
indefinable from the color of his puttees
or his mustard uniform.</p>

<p>He tramped on through the woods, hoping
that his sickness would overpower him, cast
him to the ground where he could rest.</p>

<p>“If only I’d get so sick I couldn’t walk,” he
thought, “how nice it would be.”</p>

<p>He walked on, thinking of the spot in which
he would like to lie, judging with a discerning
eye the softness and safety of various spots of
ground. The sight of a small hollow, with
breastworks of fallen trees thrown up on the
dangerous side, was attractive to him. He was
about to succumb, but decided against it, thinking
of the awkwardness of his position in case
some one should pass. And they were sure to
pass, some snooping lieutenant or orderly.</p>

<p>But he was supposed to be in an attack.
Pugh and the rest were facing the enemy at this
very moment. And here he was lagging behind!
Choking with fright, he hurried out of
the woods. The rest of the line had just broken
through the trees and now he joined them as
they marched steadily ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The field over which they were advancing
stretched like a gridiron for perhaps a mile, then
it was lost in the thickly wooded hill that rose
majestically and invincibly. “God,” Hicks
thought, “do we have to take that hill?” It
was inconceivable that it could be done, yet inconceivable
that it would not be done. There
it rose—a Gethsemane—towering in the air, austere
and forbidding.</p>

<p>Below, four waves of men with their bayoneted
rifles held at high port, advanced along
the flat field toward the hill. Hicks felt weak,
as if he wanted to crumple up. Machine bullets
clicked like keys on the typewriter of the devil’s
stenographer. Rifled bullets announced their
swift, fatal flights by little “pings” that sounded
like air escaping from a rubber tire. They
seemed to follow each other closely enough to
make a solid sheet of metal.</p>

<p>Slowly the men marched, trying to maintain
an even line under the rapid firing. Silently and
unexpectedly a whistle blew and the long lines
dropped to the ground. For the distance they
had advanced their losses were too great.</p>

<p>To lie down in the face of the firing was more
unendurable than moving toward it. The bodies
of the men felt to them more conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
than when they were on their feet. They tried
to hug the ground, to expose as little of themselves
as they could.</p>

<p>“What the hell are we going to do? Go to
sleep here?”</p>

<p>“No, they’re lookin’ for the Angel of Mons to
tell us when to advance.”</p>

<p>“This is an awful way to win a war. Are
they tryin’ to get us all killed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one of these German spies is in command,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>So ran the comment of the men, interspersed
with cries of assistance from the wounded. At
last the whistles blew again and the men rose to
their feet, chafing, half-frightened, half-angry,
under the restraint of the regulated advance.
One man started ahead of the line and an officer,
raising his voice above the frightful racket,
yelled:</p>

<p>“Come back here, you damned fool. Do you
want to get killed by your own barrage?”</p>

<p>The barrage was falling short of its mark.
Shells struck the fringe of the woods toward
which the men already had closely advanced.</p>

<p>An avion sailed over the field, a serene, self-satisfied
dove of peace. The pilot fired a rocket
when he was directly above the front line, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
wheeled back. The barrage lengthened, the
shells crashing into the trees. But if the barrage
had delayed their progress on the field, it
had hastened it in the woods. The coils of
barbed wire which had been strung before the
German front-line trench were blown to bits.
Great gaps in the wire appeared all along the
line. The men rushed through, fell into the
trench, and scrambled out the other side. The
German trench had been abandoned. The main
body of their troops was withdrawn and the
hill had been protected only by a heavy rear-guard.</p>

<p>Through the woods men were running like
mad, beating small, inoffensive bushes with the
butts of their rifles, and calling: “Come out of
there, you damned Boche.” Wherever they
saw a dugout they hurled a pocketful of hand-grenades
down the entrance, following them
with threatening exclamations. They were the
new men who had joined the platoon at the
last village at which it had been billeted.</p>

<p class="tb">It was a night for love, a night for beautifully
mantillaed women to rest their elbows on the
window casement of picturesque houses and
lend their ears to the serenade of their troubadours—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
night to wander listlessly through unreal
woods and offer words of love beneath the
benediction of a round moon.</p>

<p>Through a long, tortuous trench which, now
and again, had been partially obliterated by
the explosion of a large shell, Hicks tramped.
He had been sent out by the platoon commander
to find the French army, whose left flank was
supposed, according to orders issued before the
attack, to adjoin the right of the platoon. Picking
his way through the barbed wire over the
rough ground, he swung along with large
strides. Importantly he adjusted the strap of
his helmet more tightly about his chin. He
girded his pistol belt tighter, until his waist
was wasp-like. To his leg he buckled his holster
until it interfered with the circulation of his
blood. He liked the feel of the pistol against
his thigh. It made him feel equal to any danger.
He was a Buffalo Bill, a Kit Carson, a
D’Artagnan.</p>

<p>Progress, walking in the trench, was too dreary
for his mood. He climbed out and commenced
to stride along the field, his chest inflated, his
chin high. He thought of the men lying along
the trench, huddled together, three men under
one blanket, and he felt motherly toward them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
He thought of the Allied armies waiting for the
war to be over, so that they might return to
their homes and children, and he felt protective
toward them. He thought of President Wilson,
bearing the burden of the saving of civilization
on his thin, scholarly shoulders, and he felt paternal
toward him. Hicks it was who had been
ordered to find the French army, to link it up
with the American army so that there might be
no gaps in the ranks when the attack began on
the morrow. He walked on and on and somehow
in the dim light he lost the direction of the
trench.</p>

<p>The blasted French army was not going to be
as easy to find as he had imagined. He had
now walked much farther than he had been
told to walk, and still there was no sight or sound
of them. A little farther on his attention became
divided between the French army and the
trench. If he lost the direction of the trench,
how could he find the army, he thought.</p>

<p>Out of the stillness of the night a Maxim
sputtered. Hicks started, then ran as swiftly
as he could. He fell into the trench, quite
breathless. Feeling forlorn, he crept along the
trench, with all his native cunning. After he
had been walking he knew not how long, a form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was vaguely seen to move ahead. Hicks halted.
“Français soldat?” he questioned. “Who the
devil is that?” a voice answered. He had
returned unwittingly to his own platoon. The
platoon commander, hearing the voices, came
up.</p>

<p>“Is that Hicks?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, where have you been? I told you to
come back if the Frogs weren’t near here. They
probably haven’t arrived yet.”</p>

<p>Hicks sought out Pugh and lay down beside
him underneath his blanket. Their heads covered,
they talked in whispers.</p>

<p>“Gimme a cigarette,” Hicks commanded.</p>

<p>The cigarette, badly crumpled, was produced
from one of Pugh’s pockets.</p>

<p>“Now give me a match.”</p>

<p>After waiting a while Pugh produced a box
of matches. Then with a sigh: “Ah doan mind
givin’ you cigarettes, Hicksy, but I hate like
hell to carry ’em around for you.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“Where ya been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, out tryin’ to find some damned Frogs.”</p>

<p>“When do we go over again?”</p>

<p>“In the morning, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Hicks, having been in touch with the commanding
officer to the extent of carrying out an
order of the lieutenant’s, was expected to know
these things.</p>

<p class="tb">The obverse bank of the large ridge was barren
of foliage. No trees reared their protecting
heads, shielding the men who slipped quietly
down the side. Nor did there seem to be any
need of shelter. In the half light of the gray
dawn men moved without the usual accompaniment
of firing from the enemy. To the silently
advancing men it seemed as if there were
no enemy in front of them, nothing to hinder
their progress into the town that rested in delicate
contours on the near bank of the hill ahead.
Warily they proceeded nearer to the lines of
jagged barbed wire that ran like a gantlet, one
near the low point of the ridge, the other several
hundreds of yards away, where the hill rose to
the town. The ground, with the deep green of
long, untrampled grass, was springy under the
feet of the men. Their mouths tasted as if
they had eaten mud. Breathless, the blunt air
lay against them. From the sombre purple
trees on the hill, the unnatural stillness of the
village, there was a portent of evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Carefully, as if they were dressed for inspection,
the men avoided the barbs of the wire that
reached out to grasp and tear their clothing.
There was no hurry. Every movement was
made calmly and a trifle ponderously. Under
the silence the platoon had acquired a fictitious
dignity.</p>

<p>The last man through the tangled wire, the
platoon formed in line again, moving forward.
And then, in the dim light, the trees shot sparks
of fire. Bullets sizzled hotly into the pen.
They struck with an ugly hiss. In consternation
the platoon stood for a moment, then fell
to the ground. Their hearts flopped—and
stood still. Inside their heads wings of mammoth
windmills were revolving. Bullets spattered
on, demanding, screeching for, death.
The whole sound was reminiscent of ivory dice
being frantically shaken in a metal box.</p>

<p>Hicks, by sheer straining, tried to force his
body into the ground. He felt that his helmet
was a magnet for the flying pieces of steel. His
shoulders felt bare, the flesh undulating over his
body. A bullet struck at the right of him,
throwing up a puff of dust in his face. Cautiously,
counting every move, he unfastened his
respirator from his neck and wriggled it in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of him. He dropped his chin, letting his helmet
fall from his head upon the respirator box. A
group of bullets struck near his elbow. It hastened
his piling his bandoliers of ammunition in
front of him. Then he regretted his action.
Supposing a bullet should strike the bandoliers
and set off the cartridges! How many? Two
hundred and twenty. And what would be left
of him? He threw the bandoliers to the side.
The bullets hailed, beating fiercely like an early
spring storm. He crossed his arms in front of
him, hiding his head and shutting his eyes. But
the desire to see, to witness, was strongest, and
he guardedly twisted his neck.</p>

<p>Around him men were whining for stretcher
bearers. Plaintive and despondent, their cries
reached his ears. He did not care. A dead
man was a dead man. He grew sulky, restive,
at their repeated cries for assistance.</p>

<p>“Why can’t they let a fellow alone?” he
thought. The enemy continued with their torrent
of fire.</p>

<p>God, this was ticklish business, lying here like
a bump on a log! Could nothing be done
about it?</p>

<p>He crooked his neck, looking to the right,
where the platoon commander lay. The platoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
commander was so still that for a moment
Hicks thought he was dead. Then something
in his tense position informed him that he was
alive.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he do something? What the
devil is he good for?” Hicks wondered.</p>

<p>Pugh was lying in a spot thoroughly without
shelter. Around him the bullets spat viciously,
covering him with fine dirt. Ahead of him a
small hump of ground enticed him. It was
small, not much bigger than the crown of a
hat, but to Pugh it looked mountainous. He
had watched it now seemingly for hours, afraid
to move, believing that if he lay quite still the
enemy would think he was dead and not fire at
him. But ever the bullets came closer. He
wriggled a few inches on his belly, and stopped.
He tried it again. If only the machine-guns
would let up for a moment he was sure that he
could make it. He twisted a few more inches,
working his body snakelike. Now he could almost
touch the mound of dirt. He reached out
his hand and grasped at the hump. The fingers
of his hand had been stretched out. Now they
slowly crumpled, making a weak, ineffectual fist.
His arm remained outstretched. His head flattened
against the earth, his body relaxing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
From the left side of his head blood dripped,
forming a little pool that was quickly absorbed
by the dirt. Slowly his body stiffened out.</p>

<p>Hicks had watched him, fascinated, wanting
to cry out warning, yet fearing that his effort to
help would be a hindrance. He felt himself,
with Pugh, striving to attain shelter behind the
absurd little mound. It was his hand that
reached out to touch it!</p>

<p>“Pugh!” he called. “Oh, Pugh!” He was
excited. “Can’t you make it, Pugh?” In his
consciousness the thought pounded that Pugh
was dead, but he combated it. “Why, Jack
can’t be dead,” he argued with himself. “Why,
he just gave me a cigarette last night!” There
was total unbelief of the possibility of connecting
death with Pugh in his tone. “Jack Pugh
dead? Damn foolishness.” But he was dead,
and Hicks knew it. It made him sick to think
of it. “That’s right. It’s something you can’t
fool yourself about.”</p>

<p>He rose straight as any of the posts from
which was strung the fatal barbed wire. He
stooped over and picked up his bandolier of
ammunition. He looked around at the men lying
there on the ground and a sneer came over
his face. Methodically, as if he were walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
home, he started, toward the end of the barbed-wire
pen. A bullet neatly severed the fastening
of his puttee. He was unmindful of the fact
that it unrolled the folds of the cloth falling
about his feet.</p>

<p>Now, along the line, other men had got to
their feet. They were all in a daze, not knowing
what was happening. They sensed an enemy
in front of them, but they were not fully
aware of his presence.</p>

<p>Whizzing past, the machine-gun bullets were
annoying little insects. Hicks struck at his
face, trying to shoo the bothering little creatures
away. How damned persistent they were! He
reached the strands of barbed wire which lay between
him and the enemy and calmly picked
out a place where the wire had been broken, and
walked through. Now he had entered the
fringe of the forest. Dimly he recognized a face
before him to be that of a German. There was
the oddly shaped helmet covering the head, the
utilitarian gray of the German uniform. The
face did not at all appear barbaric. It was
quite youthful, the chin covered with a white
down. He veered the muzzle of his rifle toward
the face, and, without raising his rifle to his shoulder,
pulled the trigger. The face disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Gray uniforms, with helmets like distorted
flower-pots, fled through the woods, in front of
the mass of men that now surged forward.
Hicks followed after them, not particularly desirous
of stopping them, but wanting to overtake
them before they reached the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>Men poured into the woods, making a firm
wall studded with bristling bayonets. On their
faces was a crystallized emotion, presumably
hate. Lying out on the ground but a short time
ago they had been frozen with fear. They were
hounds on a leash being tortured. The leash
had snapped and the fear was vanishing in the
emotion of a greater fear—the maddened fight
for self-preservation. And so they scoured the
woods, charging the Germans with a white fury,
recklessly throwing hand-grenades in front of
them.</p>

<p>Their cowardice made them brave men,
heroes. Pushing on, they swung to the right
toward the town. Through the open field they
ran in little spurts, falling on their faces, rising
and rushing on. From the windows of the
houses and beside the walls bullets zinged past,
stopping men and sending them headlong upon
the ground. A small number of them rushed
into the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Bullets flew in every direction. Men toppled
down from the windows of houses. Others
raced up the steps of the dwellings. Men ran
through the streets, wild and tumultuous. They
returned to the pavement, guarding their captives.
Men poured the hate of their beings
upon the town. They wept and cursed like
lost souls in limbo. All of their fear, all of their
anxiety, all of the restraint which had been
forced on them during the morning when they
lay like animals in a slaughter-house and their
brains numbed with apprehension, came out in
an ugly fury.</p>

<p>Once the Germans found that the town was
invaded, that the men had broken through the
woods and barbed wire, they offered a weak
and empty resistance. They would readily have
given themselves up to be marched in an orderly
procession back to a prison camp. There
was only a section holding the town. But the
men did not know this. All of the stories of
German frightfulness, of German courage, of
the ruthlessness of the German foot troops,
made them battle on in fear.</p>

<p>At last two squads of worn, frightened Germans
were assembled in the town square and,
threats following after them, were marched back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to the rear. It was pitiful to see the Germans
reaching in their breast pockets and bringing
forth cigars which they cherished, and offering
them to their captors as an act of amelioration.
Some had bars of chocolate which they readily
gave and which the men readily accepted.
Some of the Germans tried even to smile, their
efforts proving pathetic because of their fear.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun threw wan rays on the distorted
bodies which fear and surprise had drawn
out of shape. As had been the case with life,
death had not fashioned their features identically.
Some wore expressions of peace, as if
they were about to enjoy a long and much-needed
rest; others sprawled with sagging chins,
from which a stream of saliva had flown; one
face grinned like an idiot’s. The shadows
lengthened, blanketing the unresisting bodies.
The men marched out of the town, leaving it to
the dead and the night.</p>

<p>The ground over which they were advancing
looked stunted, blighted by the incessant bursting
of shells, the yellow layers of gas that, now
and again, had covered it. The grass was short
and wiry, with bare spots of earth showing. A
desultory firing was being kept up by the artillery;
every now and then machine-guns would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
cut loose, spattering their lead through the air.
But the front was comparatively quiet. In an
hour at most the advancing line would have to
halt. The sun already had made its retiring
bow in a final burst of glory, and now dusk curtained
the movements of the men.</p>

<p>Orderlies hurried wearily through the rough
field, carrying messages which would affect the
activities of the troops in the morning. Officers,
indistinguishable from enlisted men, moved
along, their air of command forgotten in the
effort to keep spirit and flesh together. Their
lineaments expressed a dumb horror, through
which appeared an appreciation of the grim,
comic imbecility of the whole affair. When
spoken to, the men grinned awkwardly, trying
to mask the horror of war with a joke.</p>

<p>Some of the more energetic among them attacked
the hard ground with their shovels; the
older and wiser men sought out shell holes large
enough to protect their bodies in case of a
counter-attack.</p>

<p>The front was still, save for a nervous tremor
running through the opposing line and manifesting
itself in the jerky firing of flare pistols.</p>

<p>Through the dull purple dusk three airplanes
circled overhead, snowy angry geese. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
their present altitude it was not discernible
which were engaged in the assault, which the
attacked. The motors, which distinguished to
the experienced ear whether the airplane was
German or Allied, were not to be heard. Red
streaks traced a brilliant course through the sky,
forming a network of crimson between the fluttering
planes. The airplanes drew near each
other, then darted away. They revolved in
circles, each trying to rise higher, directly over
the other, and pour from that point of vantage
volleys of lead.</p>

<p>Detached, the men lying on the ground
watched the spectacle, enjoying it as they
would have enjoyed a Fourth of July celebration.</p>

<p>Without warning, the airplane that circled beneath
the other two rose straight in the air.
Above, it volleyed streams of bullets into the
backs of the others. The pilot of one of the
planes beneath seemed to lose control. Wing
over wing, it fell like a piece of paper in a tempered
wind. The two remaining planes raced
each other out of sight.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p>Hicks had gone through the attack without
an impression of it remaining with
him. When the platoon was caught between
the two lines of barbed wire and he had arisen,
walking toward the enemy, he had been numb.
At that time his act had been brought about
more by a great tiredness than by any courage.
He felt no heroism in him at all, only an annoyance
at his having to lie there any longer.
It all seemed so senseless. Then, dazed, he
had followed through the woods and into the
village because such action was the formula of
his existence.</p>

<p>The sights of the dead in all of their postures
of horror, the loss of those whom he had known
and felt affection for, the odor of stinking canned
meat and of dead bodies made alive again by
the heat of the day, the infuriating explosion of
artillery; the kaleidoscopic stir of light and
color, had bludgeoned his senses. Now he lay,
incapable of introspection or of retrospection,
impervious to the demands of the dead and the
living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhere in the Cimmerian darkness low
voices emanated from vague, mysterious forms.
They talked on and on in a sort of indefinable
hum. Finally it came to Hicks that the platoon
commander was searching for him.</p>

<p>“Hicks is over here,” he heard the man next
to him say. The platoon commander approached
and bent down beside him.</p>

<p>“Hicks, we’ve got to have an outpost. The
captain’s afraid there will be an attack. Take
your gun crew out about five hundred yards and
keep your eye peeled.”</p>

<p>Hicks failed to reply.</p>

<p>“Hicks, did you hear what I said?”</p>

<p>“Yes. All right.” Hicks rose and, followed
by two other men, stolidly tramped off through
the murk.</p>

<p>He strode along in the darkness, a little
ahead of the others. Abruptly an illuminating
rocket was fired from somewhere in front of
them. Each man stopped motionless, as the
incandescent arc fell slowly to the ground.</p>

<p>Stepping forward, Hicks’s foot encountered
an empty can. It bumped over the ground
cacophonously. The men behind cursed in a
thorough and dispassionate manner.</p>

<p>For four years the earth over which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
walking had been beaten and churned by the
explosions of shells. A labyrinth of trenches
had been dug in it.</p>

<p>Their bodies brushed against stiff little bushes
whose thin, wiry limbs grasped at their clothing
like hands.</p>

<p>The men had reached the brink of a large
cavity in the earth when another flare was fired.
They jumped. The hole was wide and deep
enough for them to be able to stand without
their heads appearing above the bank.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit here a while. That damned flare
didn’t seem to be more than a hundred yards
from here.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, le’s. I don’t want to git my head
shot off this late in the game.”</p>

<p>They talked on in undertones, while Hicks,
silent, smiled serenely in the darkness. Suddenly
he realized that they were not the only
persons in the trench. A few feet before him
two other bodies, huddled together, were discernible.
He had no thought of the fact that
he was between both lines, and that any other
persons who were also there must be enemies.
He only knew that he wanted to talk to these
strangers in front of him.</p>

<p>“It’s a quiet night, what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud,” the men beside him
counselled.</p>

<p>He shook his head, annoyed at their interruption,
and began again:</p>

<p>“What outfit do you fellows belong to?”</p>

<p>“Who are you talkin’ to, Hicks? What’s the
matter with you?” his loader impatiently asked.</p>

<p>Hicks ignored him. “What outfit did you
say you belonged to? What?”—as if they had
answered indistinctly.</p>

<p>He rose and stood in front of them.</p>

<p>“I asked you a civil question. Why can’t
you answer me?”</p>

<p>Their silence infuriated him.</p>

<p>“Answer me, damn it.” He grasped the
shoulders of one of the bodies, shaking them.
Beneath the clothing the flesh loosened from the
body.</p>

<p>“Hell, you’re dead,” Hicks told the body disgustedly.
He turned to his gun crew. “They’re
dead. That’s why they didn’t answer me. No
damned good.”</p>

<p>The loader turned to the other man.</p>

<p>“Le’s git outa here, Hicks is nuts.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. He gives me the creeps.”</p>

<p>They climbed out of the trench and scurried
back to their places among the platoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Hicks sat down across from the two bodies.
His elbows on his knees, his arms folded, he
lowered his head and was soon asleep. He was
awakened by voices crying:</p>

<p>“Hicks! What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing out here?”</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to git a cru de geer by stayin’ out
alone all night?”</p>

<p>He looked up and through the early dawn
saw the faces of his own platoon. Without answering
he picked up his automatic rifle which
lay beside him, and joined them.</p>

<p class="tb">The ground over which they were advancing
was flat for a long distance, then it rose in a
steep hill that stood majestically in the dawn.
Upon the ground many people had left their
marks: a group of bones, a piece of equipment,
a helmet, a rifle barrel from which the stock had
rotted.</p>

<p>There was no hindrance to the advance of the
platoon. From that point in the line which for
miles was being attacked that morning, even
the rear-guard had withdrawn. But the withdrawal
had been made to the top of the hill,
whose crest was a large plateau. Perhaps a
thousand yards from the brink, where a ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
cut the flatness of the ground, the German lines
had intrenched and lay waiting to be attacked.</p>

<p>As the platoon climbed up the hill they could
hear the friendly explosion of their own barrage.
It gave them strength to thread their way
among the bushes on the hill, ever nearing the
summit, and not knowing the sort of reception
that was waiting for them.</p>

<p>A portly captain, puffing like a porpoise,
clambered up with them. From time to time
he would stop and take from his hip pocket a
brightly colored paper sack of scrap tobacco.
Then, with a generous amount in the side of his
mouth, he would begin again the ascent. He
offered the paper bag to some of the men nearer
to him, and they accepted it gratefully, but not
cramming their mouths so full as he. The
portly captain also invented the fiction that he
was a former brewery-wagon driver in St. Louis
and that, “By God, he wished he was back on
a brewery wagon again.”</p>

<p>The men laughed obligingly but hollowly.</p>

<p>The platoon reached the summit. Little
curls of gray smoke, looking like shadowy question-marks,
rose over the plateau in the distance.
Beyond was the ridge, perhaps a mile
from the brink over which the men were climbing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
To the right of the ridge a long, white-sided,
red-topped farmhouse rested. To the
left the plateau ended in another hill.</p>

<p>It was not long after the platoon had arrived
on the level ground that machine-guns began
pouring a steady stream of lead over the field.
Hesitatingly the platoon advanced. The machine-guns
were pointing too high. Occasionally
a bullet, probably a faulty one, struck the
ground beside the slowly advancing line, but
without force.</p>

<p>The portly captain shifted his wad of tobacco,
spat a thin stream, and ordered the platoon to
halt.</p>

<p>“How many of you men have got shovels?”</p>

<p>There were half a dozen shovels and two
picks.</p>

<p>“All right, you men with shovels. Halt right
here and dig a trench as long and as deep as you
can. The rest of us—Forward!”</p>

<p>Slowly, warily, they set forth again. Now no
one spoke, not even the garrulous and confidence-breeding
captain.</p>

<p>The machine-guns aimed lower, but too
low. Only the ricochetting bullets reached the
platoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>They advanced until they were half-way to
the ridge. Then they discovered that there
were Germans much nearer to them than they
had supposed. From little humps on the
ground rifle bullets pinged past, shaving near
the ears of the men. From the hill on the left
came a whining serenade of lead. Shots were
being fired from every direction but from the
rear. The men threw themselves upon the
ground, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>After a long wait the firing abated and the
platoon started to creep forward. Instantly
their movement was met with a hail of bullets.
They lay quite still, their uniforms blending
with the russet of the grass, on which the sun
shone with intense vigor.</p>

<p>Hicks, lying at the extreme left of the platoon,
was engaged in corralling those words
which entered his mind and placing them into
two classes—words with an even number of letters,
words with an uneven number of letters.
He had long held the view that the evenly lettered
words were preponderant.</p>

<p>“P-l-a-t-o-o-n. Seven—that’s uneven.
S-e-v-e-n—that’s uneven, too. U-n-e-v-e-n—six—even.
Ha-a s-t-r-a-n-g-e—seven—again
the mystic number. M-y-s-t-i-c—six—that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
even. And n-u-m-b-e-r—six, too. Let’s see,
that’s five even and four—no, five”—he lost
track of the number of unevenly lettered words
he had thought of—his activity was interrupted
by the ridiculous words—“oh, when I die—d-i-e—uneven—just
bury me deep—d-e-e-p—even.
Deeper, deeper, deeper where the croakers sleep.
S-l-e-e-p—uneven, too, damn it. And tell all
the boys that I died brave——”</p>

<p>He broke off. Behind a bush, a few hundred
yards distant, an enormous olive that was
supported by legs was hiding. Bellied to the
ground, he started to crawl, his path describing
a small arc. His automatic rifle, grasped in the
middle by his right hand, interfered with his
movements. His abstraction was so great that
he bruised his knuckles between the rifle and the
ground. The musette bag, filled with ammunition
and suspended from his neck, was another
annoyance. When he tried more quickly to
move forward it got in his way.</p>

<p>The olive moved ever so slightly. It now
seemed to be a combination of olive and turtle,
with its queer hand rising above its body.</p>

<p>A jagged stone cut through Hicks’s trousers,
bringing the blood. He crawled on, railing at
the hot sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>A shell hole yawned in front of him. Like an
alligator slipping into the water, his body slid
down to the bottom. He was almost directly
across from the olive, and now he saw that it
was neither olive nor turtle, but a German with
a rifle pointing through the limbs of the bushes
toward his platoon. He stuck the tripod in the
bank a foot from the top of the hole. He adjusted
the stock to his shoulder and fired.</p>

<p>The German scurried from his hiding-place
out into the open. Hicks fired again. The
German stopped, and, with a queer, hopeless
gesture, his arms flung over his head, sprawled
on the ground.</p>

<p>Hicks crawled out of the hole, moving forward.
Nearly every one of the bushes concealed
a German. Hicks anticipated a day’s
occupation.</p>

<p>Now, other members of the platoon had
worked their way along the ground and near to
where Hicks lay. Bullets spattered furiously
all around. Hicks minded them less than the
perspiration which ran down his face in little,
itching rivulets. He was near enough to the
bullets for them to sound like breaking violin
strings, as they whizzed past.</p>

<p>Wasn’t that another atrocious-looking helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
behind the bush to the left? He pressed the
trigger, and a volley of shots heated the barrel
of his automatic rifle. A bullet struck a few
feet from him, kicking up a puff of dust.</p>

<p>He crawled on over the undulating ground.
From another shell hole he poured out the last
of his ammunition at the olive uniforms. Then
he threw his rifle from him.</p>

<p>And now the platoon was scattered over the
field, hiding behind bushes, behind little mounds
of dirt, giving away their position by the slight
curls of smoke from their rifle barrels. Not far
ahead were the German snipers, waiting calmly
and patiently and firing with rare judgment.
The men on both sides might have been less
human than Tin Woodmen, to judge from their
silence.</p>

<p>Smoke from the artillery shells hung in gray
volutes over the ridge. Puffs from the rifles
curled thinly skyward, lost in the blue. The
men were, to all appearances, motionless, soundless,
only their rifles speaking for them.</p>

<p>Then, like an express-train rattling over loose
ties, machine-guns broke loose from all sides.
Their bullets struck the ground beside the men,
covering the space where they were lying with
a thick haze of dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The portly captain rose and blew his whistle,
commanding the men to retreat. They needed
no command. Already they were dashing off
like frightened rabbits, scampering away to
their burrows.</p>

<p>Hicks watched them for a while, felt the angry
hail of bullets, then rose and followed after
them.</p>

<p class="tb">In their desperation the men with the shovels
and picks had dug a trench deep enough to protect
prone bodies from fire, and into it the retreating
platoon fell, released from the fear
which, like an angry eagle, beat its wings behind
them, against their heads, in their ears,
urging them on. The men turned, narrowed
out grooves in the thrown-up dirt for their rifles
to rest on.</p>

<p>The portly captain walked back and forth
behind them, admonishing them to quickness
of action.</p>

<p>“Come on now. I’m a liar, or else the
Dutchmen’ll be over here before we know it.
They’ve got the dope on us now.”</p>

<p>He paced in front of them, offering advice,
telling one man to dig a deeper barricade and
another not to expose himself. He turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to Hicks, who was lying still, engaged in nothing.</p>

<p>“Are you an automatic rifleman?” he asked.</p>

<p>Hicks answered that he was.</p>

<p>“Then take your squad out a couple of hundred
yards and establish an outpost. You can’t
tell when them devils’ll come sneakin’ up on
us.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.” Hicks turned away.</p>

<p>His loader of the night before approached the
portly captain.</p>

<p>“Sir, you hadn’t better send Hicks out on
that outpost.”</p>

<p>The captain spat. “Why the devil not?”</p>

<p>“Because, sir, he’s crazy. Last night he got
to talkin’ to dead men, and when they didn’t
answer he shook them as if he thought they
was alive.”</p>

<p>“Be off with you,” the captain replied, giving
the loader no more attention.</p>

<p>Hicks in the lead, the three men started off
toward the German lines, to halt half-way, thus
to be enabled to inform the platoon if the enemy
were attacking. Perhaps four hundreds
of yards from the German lines Hicks stopped
beside a mound of earth wide enough to conceal
the bodies of the three men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“You fellows lie down here. I’ve got to get
my gun.”</p>

<p>They looked at him agape as he strode toward
the enemy’s line near which lay his discarded
rifle.</p>

<p class="tb">An ochre cannon-ball lay suspended in the
soft blue sky. Efflorescent clouds, like fresh
chrysanthemums, were piled high atop one another,
their tips transuded with golden beams.
The sky was divided into slices of faint pink,
purple, and orange.</p>

<p>On the drab earth, beaten lifeless by carnage
and corruption, drab bodies lay, oozing thin
streams of pink blood, which formed dark, mysterious
little pools by their sides. Jaws were
slack—dark, objectionable caverns in pallid
faces. Some men still moaned, or, in a tone
into which discouragement had crept, called for
help.</p>

<p>Each body was alone, drawn apart from its
companions by its separate and incommunicable
misery. The bodies would remain alone
until to-morrow or the day after to-morrow,
when they would be furnishing a festival for the
bugs which now only inquisitively inspected
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>In the still air the scrubby bushes rose stiff
and unyielding, antipathetic to the prostrate
bodies which were linked to them by the magic
of color. The farmhouse on the gray ridge was
a gay-capped sepulchre.</p>

<p>Hicks tramped on through the field, dimly
sensing the dead, the odors, the scene. He
found his rifle where he had thrown it. As he
picked it up, the ridge swarmed with small gray
figures, ever growing nearer. He turned and
walked toward his platoon. The breath from
his nostrils felt cool. He raised his chin a little.
The action seemed to draw his feet from the
earth. No longer did anything matter, neither
the bayonets, the bullets, the barbed wire, the
dead, nor the living. The soul of Hicks was
numb.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
